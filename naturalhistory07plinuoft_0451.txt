BOOK XXVII. XLIII. 67—XLV1. 70

this account of chrysolachanum is inadequate‚ yet I
find no more detail given, for a further fault of
which our modern herbalists‚ at least, are guilty is
that they have described but briefly, and even by a
mere name, plants well known to themselves just as
if these were generally familiar. They say, for
instance, that coagulum terrae (earth renuet) is
constipating ‘² and diuretic b if taken in water or
wine, and that (XLIV) the pounded leaves of cucullus
with vinegar cure the bites of serpents and the stings
of scorpions. Some give this plant another name,
strumus, others the Greek name of strychnus. It has
black berries 3 a cyathus ofjuice from these, with two
of honey wine, is good treatment for lumbag0‚ as also
for headache if used with rose oil for bathing the
brow, while for scrofulous sores the plant itself is
applied locally.

XLV. Conferva is peculiar to running streams,
Alpine in particular, so named from cmfferuminare, to
solder together. It is more like a fresh-water sponge
than a moss or vascular plant, being a bairy, dense,
and porous mass. To my knowledge a man who, prun-
ing a very high trec, fell and broke nearly all his bones,
was treated with this plant. His entire body was en-
veloped in it; whenever it dried it was sprinkled
with its native water but rarely taken off, only in fact
for renewals when the plant lost its strength. The
patient recovered in an almost incredibly short time.

XLVI. The Cnidian grain has the colour of kermes-
red, and in size is larger than a peppercorn. Its
heating properties are so great that it is swallowed in
bread, lest it should scorch the throat in its passage.
A sovereign remedy for hemlock poisoning‚ it also
checks looseness of the bowels.
