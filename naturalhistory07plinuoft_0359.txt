This latter kind, if applied with pearl barley or by
itself after being pounded, relieves swellings and

erections; taken in water, however, it makes them

leaves like those of the lily, but red, smaller, and
springing from the ground not more than three in
number, a smooth, bare stem a cubit high, and a
double root, the lower, and larger, part favouring the
conception of males, the upper, and smaller, the con-
ception of females. Yet another kind of satyrion
they call erythraicon, saying that its seed is like that
of the viteX, but larger, smooth and hard; that the
root is covered with a red rind, and contains ⁰ a
white substance with a swcetish taste, and that the
plant is generally found in hilly country. They tell
us that sexual desire is aroused if the root is merely
held in the hand, a stronger passion, however, if it is
taken in a dry wine, that rams also and he—goats
are given it in drink when they are too sluggish, and
that it is given to stallions from Sarmatia b when they
are too fatigued in copulation because of prolonged
labour3 this condition is called prosedamum. The
effects of the plant can be neutralized by doses of
hydromel or lettuce. The Greeks indeed always,
when they wish to indicate this aphrodisiac nature of
a plant, use the name satyrion, so applying it to
crataegis, thelygonon, and arrenogonon, the seeds
of which resemble testicles. Again, those carrying
on their persons the pith of tithymallus branches are
