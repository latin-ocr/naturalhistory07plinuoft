XLI. Lenaeus calls the myrice (tamarisk) erica Tamarisk.
(heath)‚ comparing it to the brooms of Ameria. He
says that boiled in wine, beaten up with honey, and
applied to cancerous sores it heals them. Some
authorities consider it to be the same as tamarice.
But it is specific for splenio. trouble if its juice is
extracted and drunk in wine; so wonderful do they
make out its antipathy to be to this internal organ,
and to this only, that they affirm that if pigs drink
out of troughs made of this wood they are found to be
without a spleen. And for that reason they give to
a man also, if he has an enlarged spleen, food and
drink in vessels made of tamarisk. A respected
medical authority, moreover, has asserted that a
twig‚ broken off from it without its touching the
ground or iron, relieves belly·ache‚ if it be so
applied as to be pressed to the body by the tunic and
the girdle. The common people, as I have said, call
this tree unlucky, because it bears no fruit and never
is planted.‘¹

wild, which is absolutely barren, and the cultivated.
The latter in Egypt and Syria bears, and that abun-
dantly, large-stoned fruit bigger than a gall-nut and
bitter to the taste, which physicians use instead of
gall-nuts in the medical mixtures which they call
antherae. The wood also, and the blossom, leaves and
bark, are used for the same purposes, although they
are less potent. The pounded bark is given for the
spitting of blood and for excessive menstruatiom also
to sufferers from coeliae disease.⁶ An application of
