BOOK XXVII. xxv111. 46—49

employed; rarely too the extracted‘¹ juice. It is
extracted, however, as soon as the seed begins to
swell, the plantb being soaked in water for three
days when fresh and for seven When dried; it is then
boiled down to one third in a bronze vessel, ten
heminae to forty—five sextarii of water; and after
being strained to remove the solid pieces it is boiled
down again to the thickness of honey, just like Juice
obtained from the lesser centaury. But this Juice is
injurious to the stomach and head, while the decoc-
tion I mentioned is very wholesome. For it is
astringent to the stomach, and with sil, Gallie nard
and a little vinegar, brings aw ay bile, promotes urine,
soothes the bow els curing them when 111 nain, driv es
out worms from the belly, and removes nausea and
flatulence. With 1·,ue pepper and salt, it takes
away the distaste for food, and aids digestion, bringing
away undigested food. As a purge, the old custom
was to give six drachmae of the seed, three of salt,
and a cyathus of honey, in a sextarius of sea water
kept for a time, the purge being more efficacious if
the amount of salt is doubled. The pounding
however must be carefully done, as it is a difficult
task. Some have also given the aforesaid weight in
pearl barley with the addition of pennyroyal; some
the leaves in a dried fig to children, so that the
bitter taste is not noticed. Taken with iris it purges
the thorax. For jaundice it is taken raw in drink
with celery or adiantum. For flatulence it is slowly
sipped hot in water3 for the liver it is taken with

ι’ Littre and the Bohn translators say the seed. This is
possible with their reading lente coquitur, but scarcely so with
herba electa, which Ι think must mean that the plant, and not
the seed only, is used for the decoetion.
