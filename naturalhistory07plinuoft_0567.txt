LIST OF DISEASES AND AFFEC-
TIONS MENTIONED BY PLINY

To equate modern diseases with the names used by ancient
physicians is a task full of uncertainty. In some cases indeed
there is no difficulty3 a disease may have such distinctive
symptoms, and be so unlike any other, that its description
in Celsus or Galen points clearly to one, and only one, diag-
nosis, examples being intermittent malarial severs and the
common cold. Pncumonia again in both Greek and Latin
writings is usually easy to detect (although there is some
chance of confusion with acute bronchitis), and so are also
dropsy and pleurisy. Often, however, we can do no more
than divide into groups: (l) diseases and (2) the ancient
names of diseases, and then identify a group from one with
a group from the other. Many quite different diseases are
so alike symptomatically that identification can be estab-
lished, even today, only by a microscopic examination con-
ducted with a technjque quite unknown to the ancients.
Great care is needed with eye diseases and skin diseases, both
of which were far more common in earlier days than they are
with us, for dust was everywhere and disinfecting cleansing
was practically unknown. The principle of grouping is nearly
always the safest one to adopt; to attempt more is hazardous.
For example, we have on the one hand collectio, furunculus,
panus, vomica and tumor3 on the other we have “ boil‚’'
“abscess‚'² “ gathering’² and ‘⁴ carbuncle.” The group of
complaints covered by the Latin terms is nearly, if not quite,
the same as that covered by the English, but any attempt to
make more specific identification is attended with much
uncertainty; perhaps panus is the only one we can isolate
more completely.
