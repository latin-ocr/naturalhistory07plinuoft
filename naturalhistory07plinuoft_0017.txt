INTRODUCTION

and of the principles of textual criticism, is certain to
be influenced unduly by the subjective element in
his reasoning. A translator, however, although he
would prefer to spend all his time and care on 1113
proper task of translating, is sometimes compelled to
defend a new reading or suggest an emendation,
because in his opinion such a course is required by the
sense of the passage. But the extra cautiori neces-
sary in these cases has made me refrain from mention-
ing some emendations of my own that I thought
possible or even likely. It is, moreover, often for-
gotten that an ancient author—and this perhaps
applies especially to Pliny—may himself have made
mistakes, even bad ones, that escaped the notice
of his corrector, if he had one.

THE ADJECTIVE PINGUIS APPLIED 'ro LEAvsss

Timar: are in Pliny few words more perplexing than
pinguis when applied to leaves. Forcellini says
‘⁴ pinguia folia: crassa et veluti carnosa.’' Pliny,
however, uses it to translate λιπαρός, which is very
common in Dioscorides, and is rendered by Hort
“ glossy '’ (leaves) in his edition of Theophrastus.

It is therefore tempting to use ‘⁶ glossy ” to trans-
late Pliny’s pinguis (and the λιπαρός of Dioscorides)
on all occasions, but there are difficulties. The latter
has (IV 170): κλῶνας λιπαρούς, and ‘⁴ glossy twigs ”
seems unlikely3 while Pliny in XXV ἓ 124 speaks of
radicibus pinguibus, which is surely “ juicy roots.” It
would appear that “juicy '’ is at least a possible
translation of pinguis, especially as Pliny often speaks
of leaves having a sucus. Examples are: sucus
