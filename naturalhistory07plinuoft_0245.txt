are broader than those of cabbage, and hairy3 the
stem is upright, and more than a cubit high. The
seed is black and of no use. The root is single, and of
the thickness of a finger. The plants also grow in
flat country. Wild verbascum has leaves like
those of elelisphacus and tall, while the branches are
of a woody texture. LXXIV. I'here are also two
sorts of phlomis both 51130 ggy and with round leaves,
growing near the ground. A third is called
lychnitis? by some thryallis b3 it has three or at
most four leaves, which are thick and fleshy, and
suitable for lamp wicks. It is said that, placed in
the leaves of the kind we have called female, a fig does
not even begin to go bad. It is almost superfluous
to distinguish these various kinds, because they 311
have the same properties. A draught for the sting
ofscorpions is made from the root and rue in water,
which is as efficacious as it is bitter. -

drink for their stings. It is said that 3 dead scorpion,
if smeared with white hellebore, comes to life again.
Thelyphonon kills every kind of quadruped if its
root be applied to the genitals, the leaf indeed, which
is like that of cyclamen, does so before the end of the
same day. The plant itself is jointed, and grows in
shaded places. Good for scorpion bite is the juice of
betony orC plantain.
