BOOK XXV. v. 9—11

V. For this reason the other writers have given
verbal accounts only3 some have not even given
the shape of the plants, and for the most part have
been content with bare names, since they thought it
sufficient to point out the properties and nature
of a plant to those willing to look for it. To gain
this knowledge is no difficult matter3 I at least
have enjoyed the good fortune to examine all but

of our time, · I used to visit his special α garden, in
which he would rear a great number of specimens
even when he passed his hundredth year, having
suffered no bodily ailment and, in spite of his
age, no loss of memory or physical vigour. Nothing
else will be found that aroused greater wonder
among the ancients than botany. Long ago was
discovered a method of predicting eclipses of the
sun and moon—not the day or night merely but the
very hour. Yet there still exists among a great num-
ber of the common people an established conviction
that these phenomena are due to the compelling power
of charms and magic herbs‚ and that the science
of them is the one outstanding province of women.
At any rate tales everywhere are widely cur-

especially Circe of Italy, who has even been enrolled
as a divinity. This is the 1eason,1 thinl·‚ why
Aeschylus, one of the earliest poets, declared ὓ that
Italy abounds m potent herbs, and many have said the
same of Circeii, where she lived. Strong confirmatory
evidence exists even today in the fact that the Marsi,
a tribe descended from Circe’s son, are well-known
snake-charmers. Homer indeed, the first ancestor
