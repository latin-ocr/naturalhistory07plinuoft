shade, and adds a pleasing taste to wine. Some
hold that there are two other kinds of panaces,
one with a broad, the other with a slender, leafia

XV. Heracleon siderion (“ ironwort ”) is yet another
discovery of Hercules. It has a slender stem about
four fingers high, a flower of a deep red and leaves
like those of coriander. It is found near ponds and
rivers, and heals very thoroughly all wounds inflicted
b iron.²'

yXVI. A discovery of Chiron's was the vine called
chironia, which I have mentioned in my section on
the vines;c I have also mentioned a plant, the
discovery of which is attributed to Minerva.d

XVII. To Hercules too they ascribe the plant
which is called apollinaris by some, altercum by us
Romans,⁶ but by the Greeks hyoscyamos (“pig’s
bean ''). There are several kinds of it: one has
black seed, with flowers that are almost purple, and a

I would insert it before aliqui and not after adicit, and agree
with Detlefsen that huius should be changed to eius or panacis.
My other emendations are based on solio, the reading of the
MSS. V and R, and on the λεπτόφυλλον of Theophrastus.

²² Hence the name siderion, derived from the Greek σίδηρος,

² Ι have adopted here the emendation of Urlichs, omitting,
however, his a rabulis. Pseudo-Dioscorides, IV. RV 68 (Well-
mann), has twenty names for hyoscyamos, including ἐμμανές,
Ἀπολλινάρις and ἰνσάνα. Α copyist or commentator might be
tempted to add a few of these, and perhaps the vulgate text
arose in this way. To see in the corrupt arabilis or arbilis of
three MSS. a reference to the madness supposed to be caused
by hyoscyamos is natural3 hence the a rabie of Mayhoff. But
the variations in the MSS. have the appearance of corrupt
glosses. The curious a rabuli-s of Urlichs supposes a connection
between altercwm and altercer.
