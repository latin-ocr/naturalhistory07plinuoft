LXXIV. Erysipelas is treated with aizoum, Erysipezas.
pounded leaves of hemlock, and root of mand1·ake—-
it is cut into slices as is cuculnbel·‚a hung first over
must, then in smoke, and finally pounded ‘'—taken in
wine or vinegar. It is beneficia] too to foment with
myrtle wine, or to use as an ointment two ounces of
mint with one ounce of native sulphur beaten up
together in vinegar, or soot mixed with vinegar.
There are several kinds of erysipelas, among them one
called zoster-‚0 which goes round the patient's waist,
and is fatal if the circle becomes quite complete.
Remedies are: plantain with Cimolian chalk, peri-
stereos by itself and the root of persollata; as
remedies for the creeping forms can be used root of
cotyledon with honey wine, aizoum, and the juice of
linozostis with vinegar.

LXXV. Root of polypodium made up into liniment
is a remedy d for dislocationS, and the pain and swel-
ling are taken away by seed of psyllion, plantain
leaves beaten up with a little salt, ground seed of ver-
bascum boiled in wine, and hemlock with axle-grease.

and violent pounding. “Assume that the original text had

with the following phrase. There is then no difficulty in
translating.” A. C. A.

⁶ “ The girdle‚’' probably shingles. The Latin erysipelas is
a much wider term than the English.

medetur. Detlefsen, retaining medentur, took the words radix
polypodi inlita as the end of the preceding sentence (ἕ 121).
This change does not agree with Dioscorides.
