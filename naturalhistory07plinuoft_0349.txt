BOOK XXVI. L111. 85—Lv. 87

which is black, is in a pod, and it ripens at the same
time as bai-ley. This seed is of a bracinga quality,
checks diarrhoea and promotes urine; it is taken
with wine for bladder troubles.

LIV. There is another hypericon, called by some
caro, having a leaf like that of the tamarisk—it grows
underneath it—but more fleshy and less 1·ed.⁶ It is
scented, more than a span high, with a sweet and
rather pungent⁶ taste. The seed is of a heating
nature and therefore causes inflammation, but it is
not injurious to the stomach; it is particularly good
for strangury, if the bladder is not ulcerated. Taken
in wine it is also good for pleurisy, LV. as moreover
is callithrix for the bladder if beaten up with cuinmin
and administered in white wine. Vervain too if
boiled down with the leaves to one third, or its root
in warm honey wine, expels stone from the bladder,
as does also perpressa, which grows near Arretium
and in Illy1·icum; it is taken in drink, boiled down
in water from three heminae to one. Trefoil, taken
in wine, and chrysanthemum, have the same effect.
Stone is expelled also by anthemis, which has five
small leaves growing from the root, two long stems

no variant, and it is hard to see why a scribe should alter an
easy reading, whether minoribus or minutis, to minus. It is
to be noted that Pliny has pinguioribus . . . et minus rubenti-
ὂῖιθ, but Dioscorides μικρότερον δὲ καὶ λιπαρώτερον καὶ ἐρυθρόν.
If the Greek before Pliny (or his reader) had the adjectives in
Pliny's order, without connecting particles (λιπαρώτερον,
μικρότερον, ἐρυθρόν), it is just possible that they were taken
to mean “more fleshy and a little less rcd.’' So, after long
hesitation, Ι have kept the MSS. reading. Note that Pliny
read μυρίκης for ἐρείκης.

⁶ Acutus when used of sapores seems to mean merely
“ sharp '’; acer, on the contrary, means not only pungent,
but salty and with a vinegary flavour.
