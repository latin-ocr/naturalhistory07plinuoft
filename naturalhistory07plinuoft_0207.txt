BOOK XXV. xxxl. 68-xxxi11. 70

It is like origanum but with narrower and long-
er leaves; it has an angular, bushy stem a span
high, a flower like that& of ly 0111115, 3 slight loot
of no use in medicine, but with healing qualities m its
juice. The plant itself 15 gatheled in autumn, and
the Juice is exiti acted f1om the leaves. Some cut up
and soak the stems, extractum the Juice at the end of
eighteen days. This centaury the Romans call the
“ gall of earth '' on account of its extreme bitterness,
while the Gauls call it exacum, because a draught of
it evacuates from the body by stool all harmful drugs.

XXXII. There is 3 third, centauris surnamed
triorchis. Those who cut it nearly always wound
themselves. The juice it gives out is of the colour
of blood. Theophrastus a relates that it is defended
by 3 species of hawk called triorchis, which attacks
those who gather it. From this too it has received its
name. The uninformed confuse these characteris-
ticsb and assign them all to the first kind of cen-
taur .

XXXIII. Clymenus is a plant called after the
king of that name. It has leaves like those of ivy,
many branches, a hollow stem girded with joints, 3
strong smell, and seed like that of iVy3 it grows in
wooded, hilly districts. Ι shall say later what
diseases it cures if taken in drink ; but at the moment
I must point out that, while it cures, even men are
made sterile by the draught. The Greeks have said
that it is like the plantain, with a square stem and
seed-bags intertwined like the tentacles of the
polypus. The juice too is used in medicine, as it has
very great powers of cooling.

ὸ What are haec omnia. The sentence apparently means
that some people recognised only one kind of centaury.
