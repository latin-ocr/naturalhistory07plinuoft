XXVIII. There are several kinds of wormwood. Absintlzium.
The Santonic comes from the State of the Santoni in
Gaul, the Pontic from Pontus, where cattle fatten on
it, and so are found to be without gall; there is no
finer wormwood than this, the Italian being far more
bitter, but the pith of Pontic wormwood is sweet.
About its use there is general agreement, for it is a
plant very easily found, and one of the most useful‚
being moreover especially honoured at the religious
rites of the Roman people, seeing that at the Latin
festival there is a race for four—horse chariots on the
Capitoline Hill, the winner of which takes a draught
of wormwood, our ancestors thinking, I believe, that
health was a very grand prize to give. It strengthens
the stomach and for this reason it is used, as I have
said,‘² to give a flavour to wines. A decoction in
water, which is afterwards cooled in the open for a
day and a night, is also taken3 six drachmae of the
leaves with their branches are boiled down in three
sextarii ofrain water3 salt too should be added. When
very old it can still be used.¹’ There is also adminis-
tered an infusion of wormwood in water; for this
preparation should be styled ‘⁴ infusion‚'’ and an
essential of the infusion is that, whatever quantity⁶ of
water is used, for three days the preparation should
be wholly enclosed. Pounded wormwood is rarely

without the addition of salt. When old the decoetion cannot
be used.” Perhaps the nec looks to the occasions (ξ 48) when
we are told that salt is added. Mayhoff's emendations
give us : “ six drachmae . . . should be boiled down, and to
add salt is a very old usage.'’
