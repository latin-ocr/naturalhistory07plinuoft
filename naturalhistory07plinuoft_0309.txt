scorpion stings and the poison of the sea d1·agon.⁰
An embrocation also of the plant and oil is good for
snake bites. For cough, pains in the side and in the
chest, a decoction is made of a bunch of hyssop and
a quarter of a pound of honey, and verbascum with
rue is taken in water, or powdered betony in hot
water.

XV III. The stomach is st1engthened by the Juice Stoa
of scordotis, by centauiy‚ by gentian taken 111 water,
by plantain, either taken by itself in food or mixed
w'ith lentils or alicab gruel. Although betony in
general lies heavy on the stomach, yet taken in drink,
or if the leaves are chewed‚ it cures its t1·oubles;
aristolochia also may be taken in drink or dry agario
chewed, neat wine being drunk after a while,
and nymphaea heraclia or juice of peucedanum may
be applied locally. Psyllion is applied to inflamma-
tions‚⁶ or pounded cotyledon with pearhbarley, or
alzoi'im.

XIX. Molon has a striated stalk‚ soft small leaves, Molon, etc.
and a root four fingers long, at the end of which is a
head like that of gai-lic. Some give it the name of
syron. In wine it cures stomach troubles d and
difficulty of breathing, as do the greater centaury in
an electuary, plantain, its juice or as food, pounded
betony, in the proportion of one pound to half 311

ardores refriqerando (of hy dromel ln a light diet, XXII, llO);
ardores refriqerat (XXIV, 132). In XXII, 110 ab any rate
the sense of‘ feverishness'' is the most appropriate.

‘² Mayhoff supposes that there is a lacuna aster stomacho,
probably because of the strange conjunction of complaints.
But the whole of this sentence is strange, with scarcely any
form at, all, order and structure being queer.
