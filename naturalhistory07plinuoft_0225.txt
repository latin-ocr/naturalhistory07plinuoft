It is recognised at once, as its properties are less potent,
for the smallest quantity of true dittany‚taken in drink,
burns the mouth. Those who gather them store
them in 3 piece of fennel-giant or reed, which they
tie up at the ends, to prevent their losing efficacy,
There are some who say that both plants grow in many
places, but that while the inferior kinds are found on
rich soils, true dittany is only seen on rough ground.
There is also a third plant called dsttany, unlike the
others in appearance and proper-ties; the leaves are
those of sisymbrium and the branches are lai-ger, but

Mount Pelion in Thessaly, on Mount Telethrius in
Euboea, and throughout Arcadia and Laconia, and

the beasts graze‚ medicate their udders. But the milk
they drink is cow’s milk, since kine will feed on
almost any kind of plant. The potency of plants
