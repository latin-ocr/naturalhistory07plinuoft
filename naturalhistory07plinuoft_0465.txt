LXV. Holosteon (all-bone) is a plant with nothing llolosteon.
hard about it, the name being an antiphrasis coined
by the Greeks, just as they call gall sweet. Its root
is so slender as 'to look like hair. Four fingers long,
the plant has narrow leaves like grass and an astrin-
gent taste, growing on hills with deep soil. Taken in
wine for sprains and ruptures it also eloses wounds,
for it even fastens together pieees of meat when
boiled with them.

LXVI. Hippophaeston is to be found α among the 11115
thorns out of which fullers' pots aie made up, having Μ ⁰⁷²
no stem, no blossom‚ but only little, hollow heads and
many small leaves of the colour of grass. Its little
roots are whitish and soft.b Their juice is extracted in
summer3 the dose to open the bowels is three oboli,
being used especially in epilepsy‚ palsy‚ dropsy, and
to treat giddiness‚ orthopnoea, and incipient paralysis.

LXVII. Hypoglossa has leaves shaped like those of Hypoylossa·
wild myrtle‚ concave, prickly‚ and on them as it
were tongues, small leaves growing out of the leaves
proper. A ehaplet made from these and placed on
the head relieves headache.⁶

LXVIII. Hypecoon grows in cornfields and has Hypecoan
leaves like those of rue. Its properties are those of

poppy juiee.

⁰Dioseorides has (IV 129): θαμνίσκος ἐστι μυρσίνῃ ἀγρίᾳ
και λεπτῇ ἔχων τὰ φύλλα ὅμοια, κόμην δὲ ἀκανθ( ι’)ὃη καὶ ἐπ’
ἅκρου οιονεὶ γλωττίδας, παραφύσεις μικρὰς παρὰ τοῖς φύλλοις.
δοκεῖ δὲ ἡ κο ’μη περι ’,αμαα εἶναι χρήσιμον κεφαλαλγοῦσι. The
reason why Mayhoff emended concava to coma is clear, but
the Greeky and the Latin, although very alike, have some
differences, the greatest perhaps being Pliny' s corona where
the Greek has κόμη. The Latin coma, and also κόμη, are
difficult words, and there is no English word that will serve
as a translation on every occasion. Some remarks on them

will be found on pp. 482—483.
