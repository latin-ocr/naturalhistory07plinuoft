position in life, (just as if a plague chose its victims),

especially liable, another the poor.

IV. It is noted in the Annals α that it was in the
censorship ὸ of Lucius Paullus and Quintus Marcius
that there appeared for the first time in Italy the
carbuncle, a disease peculiar to the province of Corbwwffs-
Gallia Narbonensis. There died of it in the same
year as Ι compose my work two men of consular
rank, Julius Rufusc and Laecanius Bassus,c the
former through the ignorance of his physicians, who
tried lancing3 the latter, however, through his own
tearing out with a needle from his left thumb a
splinter (boil) so small that it could scarcely be
seen.‘² The carbuncle forms in the most hidden
parts of the body, and usually as a red hardness
under the tongue, like a pimple but blackish at the
top, occasionally of a leaden colour‚ spreading into
the flesh but without swelling, pain, imitation, or
any other symptom than sleep, overcome by which
the patient is carried off in three days. Sometimes
also the disease, bringing shivering‚ small pustules
around the sore, and more rarely fever, has reached

remains. The MS. E has evulsa to agree with acu. After acu
a word may have been lost, perhaps aculeo (splinter) or
furunculo (boil). Carbunculus (when not anthrax) was a,
malignant pustule or ulcer. Celsus (V 28A) says that it
should be cauterized, but does not mention cutting. “ If acus
does not mean ‘head’ here it is probably corrupt. There
are two ways of transforming a simplo boil into a general
infection. One is to lance with a knife (Rufus), the other is
to squeeze the head out with a dirty thumb (Bassus).” A.C.A.
