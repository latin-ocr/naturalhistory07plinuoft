BOOK XXVII. XXVIII. 49—XXIx. 53

Gallio nard; for the spleen‚ with vinegar, pottage or
fig. In vinegar it is an antidote to poisonous fungi,
as also to mistletoe3 in wine, to hemlock, the poison
of the shrew mouse, sea weever α and scorpions. It
is a great aid to clear vision. With raisin wine it is
applied to eye fluxes‚ and with honey to bruises.
Ear trouble is cured by sumigation with the steam
of the decoction, or when bloody pus exudes, by
pounded wormwood with honey. Three or four
twigs, with one root of Gallie nard and six cyathi of
water, are diuretic and an emmenagogue3 it is
specific for faulty menstruation if taken with honey
orb applied as a pessary in wool. With honey and
soda it is helpful for quinsy. In water it cures night
rashes. Recent wounds it heals if applied before
they have been touched with water3 it cures, more-
over‚ sores on the head. With Cyprian wax or with
fig it makes an exceptionally good application for
affections of the flanks.⁶ It also cures pruritus, but
must not be given to severish patients. Taken in
drink on sea voyages it prevents nausea; worn
under a belly-band‚ swellings of the groin.c It
induces sleep if inhaled through the nose or placed
secretly under the sufferer’s head. Put into clothes
it keeps away moth. Rubbing the body all over with
it in oil drives away gnats, as does the smoke of it
when bui-nt. Writing ink mixed with the infusion
protects the writing from mice. Ashes of worm-
wood mixed with ointment and rose-oil stain the hair
black.

XXIX. There is also a sea wormwood, called by
some seriphum, the most approved growing at
Taposiris in Egypt. At the ceremonies of Isis the
priests carry a branch of it ritually before them.
