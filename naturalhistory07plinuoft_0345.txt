good for cori-oding ulcers of the genitals. Artemisia
too in sweet wine is given for stone and for
strangury3 root of nymphaea heraclia in wine re-
lieves pains of the bladder.

' L. The same property is to be found in crethmos,
a plant very highly praised by Hippocrates. It is
also one of the wild plants that are eaten-at any
rate in Callimachus the peasant Hecale puts it on
the table—and a species of garden elatea It has
one stem a span high, and a hot seed, scented like
that of libanotis, and round. then dried it bursts,
and has inside a white kernel, which some call
cachrys. The leaves are fleshy, and whitish like
those of the olive only thicker, and salt to the taste3
there are three or four roots, of the thickness of a
finger. It grows in rocky ὓ places by the sea. It is
eaten, raw or boiled‚ with cabbage,⁶ and has a
pleasant, aromatic taste 3 it is also preserved in brine.
It is especially useful for strangury, the leaves, stem,
or root being taken in wine. The complexion also of
the skin is improved by it, but too large a dose causes
flatulence. A decoction relaxes the bowels, brings
away urine and humours from the kidneys, as does
the powder of dried alcima taken in wine‚⁰l and

⁰ I have adopted Mayhoff's conjecture because (in this
chapter at least) the form used is crethmos (fem.). Cruda
might easily be taken for crudum, spelt cruda. The MSS.
have crudum coctumve without variant, and were it not for
hanc and laryior one might take the neuters to be careless
writing‚ for there was an alternative form crethmum.

‘⁷¹ With the reading of Mayhoff z “ taken in wine it relieves
strangury more efficaciously if daucum is added.'' There is
some uncertainty about the conjecture alcimae of Jan,
accepted by both Detlefsen and Mayhoff, as it scarcely
accounts sor the confusion of the MSS„ which have alcme,
almae, alme and alce.
