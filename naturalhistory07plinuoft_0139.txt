BOOK XXIV. cn. 165-167

by the Magi and the Persian kings to give to the body
a pleasing appearance, and therefore it is also called
heliocallis. α

The same authority& σίν es the name hermesias to Herrsne Siw-
a means of procreating t>children who shall be hand-
some and good. It is not a plant, but a compound
of ground kernels of pine nuts with honey, myrrh,
saffron and palm wine, with the later addition of
theombrotion and milk. He prescribes a draught of
it to those who are about to become parents,
after conception, and to nursing mother.s This, he
says, results in children exceedino fair in mind
and body as well as good. b Of all these plants he
adds also the magical names.

Apollodorus, a follower of Democritus, added Aeschyno—
to these plants one that he called aeschynome11e,⁰ 'nene'
because on the approach of a hand it contracts its
leaves, and another called crocis, whose touch, he
declares, kills poisonous spiders3 Crateuas added the
onothuris, by the sprinkling of which in wine he
asserted that the fierceness of all animals is calmed;
and a little while ago a well—known grammariand
added anacampseros‚‘-’ by the mere touch of which, he
said, love was restored, even though the lovers parted
in hatred. These few remarks are quite enough to
have been said for the present about the wonderful
powers ascribed to plants by the Magi, as I shall
speak of thern again on a more fitting occasions

f In this chapter Pliny uses indirect speech, as if to disclaim
responsibility for the truth of the account he is giving. It is
awkward for a translator to represent this in a modern lan-
guage, and it might have been better to prefix to the chapter a,
sentence to the effect that what follows is given on the authority
of others.
