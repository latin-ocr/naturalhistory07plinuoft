say that the upper part of it brings away the biles by
vomiting, the lower part by 31001.α

XLVII. Colic is eured by any kind of panaces, by
betony‚ except when the cause is indigestion, by the
juice of peucedanum, which also, being carminative,
dispels flatulence, by the root of acoron, or by
daucum, isit is taken as a salad like lettuce. Cyprian
ladanum, taken in drink, is good for intestina] corn-
plaints, as also is powdered gentian, of the size of a
bean, taken in warin water, or plantain taken in the
morning, the dose being two spoonfuls with one of
poppy in four cyathi of wine which is not old. It is
also given before going to sleep with the addition of
soda or pearl barley, provided that it is long after the
last meal. For colitis a hemina of the juice is
injected, even when fever is present.

speak of the upper part of the root and its lower part as
aeting differently3 but it is natural enough for the upper part
of the plant to act in one way and its lower part in another.
Cf„ however, ξ 79. May it be that a κάτω 1133 been lost before
πρὸς owing to the vicinity of κάτω before καθαίρειῖ μέρος,
100, may have been originally before λημφθέν. This trans-
position of μέρος and omission of κάτω, if pre-Pliny, might
well have caused him to misunderstand the passage. What
I have said is mere speculation, and I have not thought it
wise to alter the Latin text in any way. On the other hand,
it is perhaps useful to point out, from an excellent example,
the intricate nature of 13110 problems that everywhere meet
the translator of Pliny, who is often bewildered and reduced
to guesses in which he ean have little confidence.

(2) Dioscorides has φλοιὸν ἔχουσα (ῥίζα) ἔξωθεν μέλανα,
ἔνδοθεν δὲ λευκήε Pliny: (radix) incus habet mammam (May-
hoff suggests medullam) candidam, extra cortices niqros. A little
later the Greek has χολὴν καὶ φλέγμα, 1110 Latin biles (i.e. blaek
and yellow). Pliny in fact seems to have had a Greek text
very similar to that of Dioscorides but not verbally identical
with it. So perhaps the difficulties dealt with above are even
more complicated than they seem at first sight to be.
