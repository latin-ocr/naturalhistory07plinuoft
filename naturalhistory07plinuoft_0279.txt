CIX. We call ranunculus a plant which the Greeks Hammeum
call batrachion. There are four kinds of it z one with {2²} me ἰωὴ·
fatter leaves than those of coriander and nearly as
broad as those of mallows‚ of a leaden colour, with a
tall, graceful stem and a whitish root. It grows on
moist and shaded cross-paths. The second is more
leafy, with more indentations in the leaves, and with
taller stems. The third is the smallest, with a strong
smell and a golden flower. The fourth is like it,
but the flower is of the colour of milk. All have
a caustic property3 if leaves are applied raw,
they raise blisters as does fire. Accordingly they
are used for leprous sores and itch, and to remove
scars on the skin3 they are ingredients of all caustic
preparations. They are applied to mange, but are
removed quickly. The root if chewed up for tooth-
ache too long breaks off the teeth‚ and the dried
root chopped fine makes a snuff. Roman herbalists
call it strumus, because it cures scrofula aud super-
ficial abscesses, if a piece of it is hung up in the
smokefl They believe that if it is replanted the
maladies they have cured ἶ) break out again, a similar
criminal use being made of the plantain. Sores
inside the mouth are cured by juice of plantam, and
also by the chevved-up leaves and roots, even if the
mouth is suffering from a flux; sores and bad breath
are removed by cinquefoil, sores by psyllium.

CX. I shall also give some prescriptions for Ossemm
offensive breath, which is a very embarrassing bream·
complaint. For this purpose myrtle leaves are
taken and an equal weight of leaves of lentisk with
half the quantity of Syrian gallffluts. This com-

The nearest instance I have found to curare in Pliny in
tho strict sense of ‘⁸ cure.''
