LIST OF DISEASES

Ap υ lema. ——Greek for abscess.
Arq ema. ——A small white ulcer,
partly on the cornea, partly on
the sclerotic eoat of the eye.
Articulanus morbus.—This in
XXII 34 is joined to poda-
micus, and so means probably
not gout but arthritis.
Asthma.—Apparently only
XXVI 34. See also XXV 82.
Atrophzcs. -—“ IVasting away‚”
of all such conditions, of which

phthisis is one.

Βοα. —- ‘A disease when the
body is red with pimplesss'
XXIV 53. See also XXVI
120. An exanthem not cer-
tainly identified. Shingles is
localised. It cannot be, as
Hardouin thought, measles,
because that disease seems to
have been first described by
Rhazes.

Cachecta.-A patient who is in a
very bad state of health ; some-
times a ‘⁴ eonsumptive '’ patient
is meant.

Cacoethes.—A Greek adjective
applied to sores that are very
difficult or impossible to cure;
“ malignant ’⁷ is the nearest‚but
not quite exact, equivalent.

Calculus.—Stone or gravel in
the bladder.

Cali90.—Dimness of the eyes,
hard to distinguish from
nubecula (film) and caliqatio
(mistiness).

Carbunculus.—In XXVI 5, 6
seems certainly to be anthrax,
and Pliny's description re-
sembles that of Celsus V 28, 1.
The word was, however, used
of minor affections; for
example, carbunculus oculi is
a stye, and it is often used of
a bad abscess.

C'arcinoma.—Superficial malig-
nant disease, severe forms os
which are called cacoeche.
It seems impossible to dis-
tinguish‚ at least in Pliny,
carcinoma from ulcera camethe,
phaqedaena and qanqraena.

Carcliacz‹s.—The adjective refers
to either disease or patient.
Sometimes a simple ailment,
heartburn, is referred to.
at other times a serious
complaint, said by W. G.
Spencer on Celsus ΙΙΙ 19 to
be a kind of syncope. In fact
the reference may be to any
ailment supposed to be con—
nected with the heart.

Ceplmlaea.—Aretaeus (ΙΙΙ 2)
calls this a severe, chronic
headanhe, and says that there
are ἰδέαι, μυρίαι. Persistent
neuralgia, except when it
means malarial headaehe, must

⁴ be the complaint referred to.

Genium—Described by W. G.
Spencer on Celsus V 28, 13
as a follicular abscess among
hair. Its appearance—mppc'ov
means ‘⁶ honeycomb ''—en-
ables us to distinguish it from
panus ; it was also often more
severe.

Chirayra.—Gout or gouty pains
in the hands. But see
podaqra.

Cholera.—Perhaps never Asiatic
cholera, but cholera ‘nostras
and possibly certain types of
dysentery and severe diar-
rhoea. The word is derived
from χολή, “bile ''

Clavus. —Wa1·,t corn or callus.

Coeliacus morbus. —u. G.
Spencer on Celsus IV 19,1
(last note) says that the
author appears to be de-
