only say that the wild plant has the broader leaves,
that this is the more efficacious‚ and has the more
pungent seed.

LXXVIII. A description of leucographis I have
nowhere found in writing. I am the more surprised
at this because in three-oboli doses with saffron it is
considered useful for haemoptysis‚ and also for the
coeliae disease3 beaten up in water and applied as a
pessary for excessive menstruatiom useful too as
an ingredient of eye salves, and for filling up ulcers
that form on tender parts of the body.

LXXIX. Medion has leaves like those of cultivated
seris ας the stem is three feet long, on which is a
large, purple, round flower, bearing tiny seeds; the
root is half a foot long. The plant grows on shaded
rocks The root checks excessive menstruation‚
two-drachma doses, with honey, being taken in the
form of an electuary for a few successive days. For
the same purpose the seed too is given in winess’

LXXX. Myosota or myosotis is a smooth ⁶ plant
with several stems growing from one root, these being
red to a certain extent and hollow; narrow leaves grow
at the bottom‚d longish, with a spine along the back,
dark, carefully arranged in pairs at regular intel-vals.
There are slender stalks growing from the axils, and
the blossom is blue. Thc root, of the thickness of a
finger, is fringed with many filaments like hairs.
It has †septic and ulceratingl· propertiesf and so

be wrong. Unfortunately Dioscorides (ΙΙ 183) is of no help
here, for although he mentions the cure, he says nothing about
the properties Of the root t ἡ δὲ ῥίζα καταπλασθεῖσα αἷγιλώπια
ῑαΤαι.

Ι suggest that emclceratrix means, not ⁴⁶ ulce1·ating‚'’ but
‘⁴ clearing away ulcers‚⁷' just as eoeulcerare corpus in XXIII
§ 22 means “ free the flesh from sores.⁷’ Cf. tussim exasperant
