described‘² in my account of exotic plants. The
kind imported out of Macedonia they call buco-
Ιίοοη,ὸ because herdsmen collect the sap as it exudes
of its own accord3 this evaporates very rapidly. As
to the other kinds, the least popular is the dark
and sost, for these qualities are signs of adulteration
with wax.

XII. A second kind they call heracleon, and say Heracleon-
that it was discovered by Hercules3 others call it
Heracleotic or wild origanum, because it is like the
origanum Ι have already described30 the root is of
no value.d

XIII. A third kind of panaces has the surname Chironium.
chironium from Chiron the centaur who discovered
it. Its leaf is like that of lapathum, but larger and
more hairy. The blossom is golden and the root
small. It grows in rich soils. The blossom of
this kind is very efficacious‚ and therefore has a
wider range of usefulness than that of the kinds
mentioned above.

XIV. The fourth kind is the panaces discovered by centaurion.
the same Chiron and surnamed centaurion, but also
pharnaceon‚ a name derived from king Pharnaces,
as there is a controversy whether he was, or was not,
the discoverer. This kind is grown from seed,
having longer leaves than the other kinds, and
with serrated edges. Its scented root is dried in the

gandor eius coacti ,· sequens pallido statera, πέραν colos inpro-
atur.

⁶ “ Bucolic,” ‘⁴ pastoral,'‘ ‘⁴ pertaining to oxen.‘'

⁶ See XX. ξ 170.

‘¹ I think that a semicolon should be put. ab inutili. If with
Detlefsen and Mayhoff we put a comma only, we get the sense ε
“ tlhe origanum I have already described, whose root is of no
va ue.”
