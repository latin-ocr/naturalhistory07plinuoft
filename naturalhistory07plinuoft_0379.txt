BOOK XXVI. Lxxv. 122—Lxxv11. 125

The leaves of ephemeron are applied in the form of
liniment to tumours and swellings that are still able
to be dispersed.

LXXVI. The most striking symptom of jaundice Jamulios.
is the effect upon the eyes; the bile penetrates
even between the membr-anes, thin and close to-
gether as they are. Hippocrates ‘³ says that if
jaundice supervenes from the seventh day of a sever
it is a fatal symptom. I however know of recoveries
even from this desperate condition. But cases of
jaundice occur without sever, and can be overcome by
the greater centaury‚ taken in drink as I have pre-
scribed‚b by betony, by three-oboli doses of agai-ic in
a cyathus of old wine, and by three-oboli doses of
vervain leaves taken for four days in a hemina of
warmed wine. The quickest remedy however is
juice of cinquefoil taken in doses of three cyathi with
salt and honey.c Three-drachmae doses of root of
cyclamen are taken in drink while the patient is in a
warm place protected from chilly draughts—-the
medicine induces sweats full of gall—‚ and good is
done by leaves of tussilago in water, by seed of lino-
zostis of either kind sprinkled in drink or boiled
down with wormwood or chick peas, by hyssop
berries taken with water, by the herb lichen, the
patient during the treatment abstaining from all
other vegetables, by polythrix administered in wine,
and by struthion in honey wine.
