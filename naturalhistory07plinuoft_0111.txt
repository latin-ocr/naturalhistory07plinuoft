LXXVI. Among the different kinds of brambles is
one called rhamnos by the Greeks, paler, more bushy,
throwingout branches with straight thorns,not hooked
like those of other brambles, and with lai-ger leaves.
The other kind of it is wild, darker and inclining to
red, bearing a sort of pod. A decoction of the root
of this in water makes a drug called lycium.
The seed of it brings away the after-birth. The other,
the paler kind, is more astringent, cooling, and more
suitable for the treatment of gatherings and wounds.
The leaves of either kind, raw or boiled, are made up
into an ointment with oil.

LXXVII. A superior lycium is said to be made from
the thorn which is also called chironian α boxthorn,
the characteristics of which I have described ὗ among
Indian trees, for Indian lycium is considered by far
the best. The pounded bi Γ11101105 and ioots, which
are of extreme bitterness, are boiled in water in a
copper vessel for three da'ys3 the woody pieccs are
then taken away and the rest boiled again until it is of
the consistency of honey. It is adulterated with bitter
juices, even with lees of olive oil and with ox gall.
The froth, which may be called the flower of the
decoction, is an ingredient of remedies for the eyes.
The rest of the juice is used for clear-ing spots from
the face and for the eure of itch, chronic fluxes
of the eyes and corroding sores in their corners, pus
in the ears, sore tonsils and gums, cough and spitting
of blood. For these a piece the size of a bean is
swallowed, or if there is discharge from wounds it is
applied locally, as it is to ehaps, ulcers of the genitals‚
excoriations, fresh, spreading and also festering
ulcers, excrescences in the nostrils and suppurations.
It is also taken in milk by women for excessive men-
