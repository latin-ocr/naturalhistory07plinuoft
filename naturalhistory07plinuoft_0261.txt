XCIV. Some α physicians used to employ the
mandrake also; afterwards it was discarded as a
medicine for the eyes. What is certain is that the
pounded root, with rose oil and wine, cures fluxes
and pain in the eyes. But ⁶ the juice is used as an
ingredient in many eye remedies. Some give the
name circaeon to the mandi-ake. There are two
kinds of it: the white, which is also considered male,
and the bhwk, considered female. The leaves are
narrower than those of lettuce‚ the stems hairy, and
the roots, two or three in number, 1·6(1(11511,6 white

diggers avoid facing the wind, first trace round the
plant three circles with a sword, and then do their dig-

the top, and from the root, which is opened by pricks
or boiled down to a decoction. Even the shoot of its
root can be used, and the root is also cut into round
slices and kept in wine. The juice is not found
