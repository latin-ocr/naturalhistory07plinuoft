BOOK XXV. xcxv. 149-150

everywhere, but where it can be found it is looked α
for about vintage time. It has a strong smell‚ but
stronger when the juice comes from the root or fruit
of the white mandrake. The ripe fruit is dried in
the shade. The fruit juice is thickened in the sun,
and so is that of the root, which is crushed or boiled
down to one third in dark ὸ wine. The leaves are
kept in brine, more effectively those of the white
kind. The juice of leaves that have been touched
by dew are deadly.⁶ Even when kept in brine they
retain harmful properties. The mere smell brings
heaviiiess of the head and—although in certain
countries the fruit is eaten-those who in ignorance
smell too much are struck dumb, while too copious
a draught even brings death. When the mandrake
is used as a sleeping draught the quantity adminis-
tered should be proportioned to the strength of the
patient,d a moderate dose being one cyathus. It is
also taken in drink for snake bite, and before surgical
operations and punctures to produce anaesthesia.
For this purpose some find it enough to put thern-
selves to sleep by the smell.e A dose of two oboli
of mandrake is also taken in honey wine instead of
hellebore—but hellebore is more efficacious s—as an
emetic and to purge away black bile.

² A clear indication, if one were needed, that the ancients
used such anaestheties, at the best very poor ones, as they

ossessed.
p s The usual punctuation would give: ‘⁴ Hellebore is more
efficacious as an emetic and purge of black bilc.⁷’ The punctua-
tion of Mayhoff is neat, perhaps too neat for Pliny; but we
must take into account a feature of Pliny's style not generally
recognised—his habit of making parenthetic remarks. This
habit sometimes causes misunderstandings, because a reader
may easily fail to observe an instance.
