honey wine or raisin wine, or with sesame. It
carries off phlegm and bile by stool. Sores in the
mouth it cures, but for corroding ulcers in the mouth
the leaf is eaten with honey.

XLI. The third kind of tithymallus is called
paralius α or tithymallis. It has a round leaf, a stem
a span high, reddish branches, and a white seed,
which is gathered when the grape begins to form,
and after being dried and pounded is taken in doses
of one acetabulum as a purgative.

XLII. The fourth kind of tithymallus is called
helioscopiOS.²’ It has the leaves of purslane, and four
or five small branches standing out from the root,
which are reddish, half a foot high and full ofjuice.
This kind grows around towns, and has a white seed
of which pigeons are very fond. The name helio-
scopios has been given to this plant because it moves
its heads round to follow the sun. Bile it carries
away by urine or stool when taken in doses of half
an acetabulum in oxymel. Its other uses are the
same as those of characias.

XLIII. The fifth kind is called cyparittias, because
its leaves are like those of cypress. It has a double
or triple stem, and grows in flat country. Its
properties are the same as those of helioscopios or
characias.

XLIV. The sixth kind is called by some platy-
phyllos, by others corymbites, and by others
amygdalites from its likeness to the almond tree.
Its leaves are broader than those of any other. It
kills fish. Root, leaves or juice are purgative if a
dose of four drachmae is taken in honey wine or
hydromel. It is specifice for carrying away morbid

fluids.
