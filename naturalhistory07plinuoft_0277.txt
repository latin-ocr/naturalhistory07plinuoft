hand some have given it with wine for jaundice, and
as a cure for all complaints of the bladder, heart, and
liver. They have said that it brings away gravel
from the kidneys. They prescribed for sciatica a
drachma with oxymel after a walk, this dose being
also very useful in raisin wine for colic; they re-
commended it also as a salad with vinegar for the
internal organsa generally, and they planted it in
gardens. There have been some who distinguished
a second variety, but without pointing out its quali-
ties, prescribing it to be taken in water for snake
bite, and to be eaten by epileptics. I myself
shall treat of it only in so far as the Romans have
found out by experiment how to use it. Its down,
with saffron and a little cold water, is applied crushed
to eye fluxes and, roasted With a grain of salt, to
scrofulous sores.

CVII. Ephemeron has the leaves of a lily, but Elhemerpn
sm aller, a stem of the same length, a blue flower, a do ¹¹52·ng eh ’
seed of no value‚ and a single root of the thickness
of a thumb, a sovereign remedy for the teeth if it is
cut up into pieces in vine-gar, boiled down, and used
warm as a mouth wash. And the root also by itself
arrests decay if forced into the hollow of a decayed
tooth. Root of chelidonia is crushed in vinegar and
kept in the mouth, dark hellebore is plugged into
decayed teeth, and loose teeth are strengthened by
either of these boiled down in vine-gar.

CVIII. A plant that grows in rivers they call the {ssbfelfflm
bath of Venus. In it is a worm which is rubbed
round the teeth or plugged with wax into the hollow
of a tooth. Ca1e must be taken that the plant

does not touch the giound after being pulled up.
