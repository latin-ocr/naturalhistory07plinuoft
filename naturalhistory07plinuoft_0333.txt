applied locally for lichen3 it is taken internally as a
purge, being both an emetic and an aperient3 apart
from this it is bad for the stomach. Taken in drink
with the addition of salt it brings away phlegm, but
to bring away bile saltpetre must be added3 if it is
desired that the purging shall be by stool, the drink
should be vinegar and water3 if by vomiting, raisin
wine or hydromel. A moderate draught is made up
with three oboli. It is better taken on a fig, and after
food. The juice burns the throat slightly3 for it is
of so heating a nature that, applied α externally by
itself to the body, it raises blisters as fire does, and
so it is sometimes used as a cautery.

XL. The second kind of tithymallus is called

myrtites by some, and caryites by othei-‚s having ιιζῗηαι

leaves like those of the myrtle, pointed and prickly,
but larger, and growing like the first kind in rough
ground. Its heads are gathered when the barley is
beginning to swell, dried in the shade for nine days
and thoroughly dried in the sun. The fruit does not
ripen all together, but a part in the following year.
It is called 'the nut, and for this reason the Greeks
have surnamed this tithymallus caryiteS.⁶ It is
gathered when the harvest is ready, washed‚ and
then dried. It is given with twice the amount of
black poppy,G the dose being one acetabulum alto-
gether. Itis a less violent emetic than the preceding,
as are also the others. Some have given the leaf
also in a similar dose, the nut however by itself in

no neuter noun it could refer to, but inposita might have been
written by a scribe who was worried by inposita.

¹² The Greek word κάρυον means ‘⁴ a nut.⁷'

⁶ Hort on Theophrastus IX, xi, 9, from which Pliny took
his account, says that “ μέλαινα must here mean ‘ dark,’ i.e.
red.”
