thorny calyx‚‘² growing in Galatia. The common
kind, however, is whiter and more bushy; it is taller
111311 1116 poppy. The seed of the third kind is like
the seed of irio; but 311 kinds cause insanity b and
giddiness. A fourth kind is 5011, downy, richer in
juice 111311 1116 0111615, with a white seed, and growing
in places near the 563. This is a kind that medical
men have adopted, 35 they have that with a red seed.
Sometimes, however, the white seed turns red if
gathered before getting ripe, and then it is rej ected;
and generally no kind is ever gathered before it
1135 become dry. It has the character of wine, and
therefore injures the head and brain. Use is made
of the seed as it is or when the juice has been extracted
from it. The juice is extracted separately also from
the stems and leaves. They also use the root, but the
drug is, in my opinion, a dangerous medicine in any
form. In fact, it is well known 11131 even the leaves
affect the brain if more than four 316 taken in drink;
yet ⁶ 1116 3116161115 used 10 take them in wine under the
impression 11131 fever was 50 brought down. An oil
is made from the seed, 35 Ι have said,d which by
itself if poured into the ears deranges the brain.
It 15 3 wonderful thing that they have prescribed
remedies for those who have taken the drink, which
implies that it is 3 poison, and yet have included it
among remedies; so unwearied have been researches
in making every possible experiinent, even to com-
pelling 2 poisons to be helpful remedies.

It makes very little difference whether we read coqerent
with Jan or coyant with Mayhoff. The 11151 takes its sequence
i'rom 1116 idea of past time, the second from 1116 idea of present
time, both implicit 111 nullo fine.
