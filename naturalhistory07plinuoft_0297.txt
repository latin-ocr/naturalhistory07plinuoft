system of hydropathy‚ which appeals to man's
greedy love of baths, and many other things pleasant
and delightful to speak of, which won him a great
professional reputation. His fame was no less great
when, on meeting the funeral cortege of a man
unknown to him, he had him removed from the pyre
and saved his life. This incident I give lest any
should think that it was on slight grounds that so
violent a changea took place. One thing alone
moves me to anger: that one man, of a very super-
ficial race, beginning with no resources, in order to
increase his income suddenly gave to the human race
rules for heasth, which however have subsequently
been generally discarded. The success of Asclepiades
owed much to the many distressing and crude features
of ancient medical treatment; for instance, it was
the custom to bury patients under coverings, and to
promote perspiration by every possible meanS, now

which physicians used to treat by thrusting an

invented by one Sergius Oiata. This kind of bath had
a flooring suspended over the hyppcaust. Asclepiades
apparently prescribed a “Turkish bath” as a substitute for
sunshine in cases where genial warmth was beneficial.
