offspring and also their plants. May this gift
of the gods last, I pray, for ever! So truly do they
seem to have given to the human race the Romans
as it were a second Sun.

II. But who could revere enough the diligent
research of the ancients? It is established that
of all poisons the quickest to act is aconite‚ and that
death occurs on the same day if the genitals of a
female creature are but touched by it. This was the
poison that Marcus Caelius accused Calpurnius Bestia
of using to kill his wives in their sleep. Hence the
damning peroration of the prosecutor’s speech ac-
cusing the defendant’s finger. Fable has it that
aconite sprang out of the foam of the dog Cerberus
when Hercules dragged him from the underworld‚ and
that this is why it grows around Heraclea in Pontus,
where is pointed out the entrance to the underworld
used by Hercules. Yet even aconite the ancients
have turned to the benefit ofhuman health‚ by finding
out by experience that administered in warm wine it
neutralizes the stings of scorpions. It is its nature
to kill a human being unless in that being it finds
something else to desti-oy. Against this alone it
struggles, †rega1·ding it as more pressing than the
find.† [This is the only sight, when the aconite

is brilliant, but if it is the original how did praesentius arise?
I leave the text and translation within daggers, as I con-

of the text of Hermolaus Barbarus is excellent : “ as though it
had found inside a foe to match it.'’ Professor Andrews thinks
that the text is sound, with the sense: “as though it had
found something more urgent, and so fights solely with this.’'
