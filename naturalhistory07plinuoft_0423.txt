which is rich but not dry. The root is used in wine
or water for dysentery, diarrhoea, ruptures and
s rams.

pVII. Alypon is a small sprout with a soft head, and
not unlike beet, sharp to the taste and viscous, very
pungent and burning. In hydromel with a little salt
added it loosens the bowels. The smallest dose is
two drachmae, a moderate one four, the maximum
being six. When given as a purge it is taken in
chicken broth.“

VIII. Alsine, which some call myosoton, is found
in groves3 hence its nameJ' It begins to grow just
after midwinter, and withers at midsummer. When
it puts forth its leaves, they are like the ears of little
mice. However, I shall describe another plant‚⁶
to which more properly would be given the name
myosotis. Alsine would be just the same as helxine,
were it not that it is smaller and less hairy. It
grows in gardens and especially on walls.d When
being bruised it smells like cucumber. It is used for
gatherings and inflammations, and for all purposes
for which helxine is employed, but with less efficacy.

certain emendation of Hermolaus Barbarus should appear
in no extant MS.; the variants give some support to May-
hoff’s suggestion vetere. It may be that ea arose from a
misplaced a, that Io. Muller's purqationi is right, and that
quibusdam (datur follows) should replace quibus. I print
between daggers, as no emendation is very convincing.
Dioscorides’ account of ἄλυπον is different from this chapter,
and affords little or no help.

¹² From the Greek ἄλσος (grove).

‘¹ Pliny says in the first sentence that it grows in groves.
He has expressed himself carelessly, but the first habitat is
displaced in order to explain the name alsine, but the plant
commonly grows in au the places named.
