some nymphaea pteris. *It has only one stem, and
is not bushy‚ but shorter, soster and more compact
than the other, and channelled with leaves at the
root. The root of both kinds fattens pigs. In
both kinds the leaves are pinnate on either side,
whence the Greeks have named them “ pteris.” θ
The roots of both are long, slanting‚ and blackish‚
especially when they have lost moisture 3 they should,
however, be dried in the sun. Ferns grow every-

be dug up at the setting of the Pleiades. The root
must be used only at the end of three years, neither

for one day, with a taste of honey beforehand.c
Neither fern should be given to women, since either

barrenness when they are not. Reduced to powder
they are sprinkled over foul ulcers as well as on the
necks of draught animals. The leaves kill lice and will
not harbour snakes, so that it is well to spread them in
suspected places3 by the smell too when bui-nt they
drive away these creatures. Among ferns also
