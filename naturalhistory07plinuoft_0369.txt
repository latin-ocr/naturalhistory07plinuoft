Onothera also, that is onear, is soporific although
exhilarating in wine,‘2 having leaves like those of the
almond tree, rose-coloured blossom, a bushy shape
and a long· root, which when dried smells of wine,
and given in their drink soothes even wild beasts.
Indigestion causing nausea is relieved by betony;
it also if taken in drink after dinner promotes
digestion3 in doses of one drachma by weight in
three cyathi of oxymel it also removes the after-
effects of drink, as does agario too taken in hot water
after food. Betony is said to cure paralysis and so

some miscellaneous ones, but onothera is surely added (by

the et) to the list of soporifics.

⁶ I have kept the reading of R (queried as doubtful by
Mayhoff) and of Gelenius because it avoids the dislocation of
thought (violent even for Pliny) involved in the vulgate and
accepted by Mayhoff. The use of argemonia is thus confined

to the cure of paralysis, or partial paralysis.
