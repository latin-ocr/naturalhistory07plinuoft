BOOK XXVI. Lvm. 89-L1x. 92

strangury by three-oboli doses of agario in one
cyathus of old wine, by two-drachmae doses of root
of trefoil in wine, and by one-drachma doses of
daucum or of its seed. Sciatica is cured by pounded
seed and leaves of erythmdanus, by panaces taken in
drink and rubbed on the affected part, by polemonia,
and by a decoction of the leaves of aristolochia.
Agaric indeed cures both the tendon called “broad ” α
and pain in the shoulders‚ the dose being three oboli
taken in one cyathus of old wine. For sciatica
cinquefoil is both taken in drink and applied, as is
also a decoction of scammony ὓ with barley meal
added. The seed of either kind of hypericum is
taken in wine. Affections and ehafings of the seat
are cured very quickly by plantam, condylomata by
cinquefoi13 if however these have already become
callous‚ by cyclamen root in vinegar. The blue
anagallis pushes back prolapsus of the anus; the red
anagallis on the contrary makes it worse. Cotyledon
is wonderfully good treatment for condylomata and
for piles; so is, for swollen testicles, the application
of root of acoron, pounded and boiled down in
wine. Cato ⁶ says that those carrying on their persons
Pontic wormwood never suffer from chafing between
the thighs. Other authorities add pennyroyal to
the list of remedies3 this, gathcred by a fasting man
and tied behind him, prevents pains in the groin or
relieves those which have begun already.

LIX. Inguinalis (“ groin-wort '')‚ called by some Inquinalis.
argemonion, a plant growing anywhere in briar
patches‚ needs only to be held in the hand to be of
benefit.
