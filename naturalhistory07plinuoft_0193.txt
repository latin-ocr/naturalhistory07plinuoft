like those of bulbs, and with a root fringed like that of
onions. The black hellebore kills horses‚ oxen and
pigs; so they avoid it, although they eat the white
kind. The latter is said to be ripe at harvest, and it
grows abundantly on Mount Oeta, and the best on one
part of it, around the place called Pyra. The black
kind is to be found everywhere, but the better sort
grows on Helicon, a mountain celebrated also for
other plants. Next after the white hellebore of Oeta
that of Pontus is most approved3 the third place is
taken by that of Elea, which is said to grow among
vines, and the fourth by hellebore of Parnassus,
which is adulterated by hellebore from the neigh-
bouring country of Aetolia. Of these the black
kind they call melampodium; with it they fumigate
and cleanse houses, sprinkling it on sheep, and
adding a formal prayer.‘¹ This kind is gathered
with even greater soi-malities. First a circle is
drawn round it with a sword; then the man who is
going to out it looks at the East with a prayer
that the gods will grant him permission to do so.
He also keeps on the look—out for a flying eagle—for
generally one is present when men cut—and if an
eagle flies near, it is a sign that the gatherer will die
in that year. The white too is not easy to gather:
it is very oppressive to the head unless garlic is
eaten beforehand‚ wine swallowed every now and
then and the plant dug up quickly. Some call the
black kind ect0mon‚²² others polyrrhizonf T his
purges by stool‚ but the white kind does so by
voniiting‚ and carries away what might cause diseases ;
