ADDITIONAL NOTES

The word coma in Pliny, like κόμη in Greek, is sometimes
perplexing when it is used, not literaHy, but of a part of a plant
or tree. This is especially true when the word folium occurs
in the immediate context.

When used in its strict sense coma is the hair of the head,
and so can be coupled with barba. We should expect, there-
fore, to find it used figuratively of anything that grows at
the top of a plant or tree, such as the tuft of a bulrush; see
Pliny XXVI ξ 62 in cacuminibus coma iunci. In several
passages, however, coma seems to be foliage generally, while
folium is used of a single leaf. Examples are ε

XII ξ 113. solium proximum tuber-i, perpetua coma.

XVI ἓ 84. neque his autem quae semper retinent comas
eadem solia durant.

XIX ξ 102. schistam hieme cum co‘ma sua relinquunt,
vere folia detrahunt.

In Dioscorides IV ἓ 129 there is a distinct contrast between
φύλλα and κόμη, which leads Mayhoff in the parallel passage of
Pliny (XXVII ξ 93) to substitute coma for the concava of the
MSS. Here Mayhoff suggests, without adopting it, comantia,
citing as a parallel XIII ξ 59, semper comantibus soliis. Here,
however, the addition of semper makes a differenee. Leaves
can be semper comantia, “ evergreen‚'' but one could hardly
say that the leaves are “ like those of wild myrtle, comantia,
spinosa.’' The passage of Dioscorides reads: μυρσίνῃ ἀγρίᾳ

. . ἔχων τὰ φύλλα ὅμοια, κόμην δὲ ἀκανθώδη κ.τ.λ. Here there
seems to be a real difference between the two words, nor can
κόμη be a filament‚ as that could hardly be ἀκανθώδης.

There remain those passages where comae means “hair-
like filaments‚'’ the clearest being XXVI §1332 dependere
comis iunceis multis, nimis, at ex equorum cauda. Two
dubious instances near the beginning of Book XXVII eall sor
special notice. In § 26 we have : comae tritae sanquineo suco
