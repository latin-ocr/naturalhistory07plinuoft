XC. For diseases of women a very good general Diseases os
remedy is the black seed, taken in hydromel‚ of the ²⁰⁰⁷⁷²‘’'²’
plant paeonia; its root also has the same property.
An emmenagogue is seed of panaces with wormwood,
and a sudorific emmenagogue is scordotis, taken
internally or α applied locally. Betony in doses of one
drachma to three cyathi of wine is taken for all
uterine affections‚ and for those that result from
child—birth. Excessive menstruation is checked by
an application of achillia or a a sitz bath in a decoction
of it. To the breasts is applied henbane seed in wine
—but to the uterus henbane root in a plaster b—and
also chelidonia. A pessary of panaces roots brings
away retarded after-birth or the dead foetus. The
uterus is purged by panaces, taken by itself in wine,
and by a pessary of it vss’th honey. Polemonia taken
in wine forces out the after-birth, and the fumes of it
when burnt correct the uterus.c J uice of the lesser
centaury taken in drink or used as a fomentation is an
emmenagogue, and the root of the greater centaury‚
used in the same ways, is good for uterine panis,
while if it is scraped and applied as a pessary it
brings away a dead foetus. Plantain is applied as a
pessary d in wool for pain in the uterus ; for hysterical
suffocation it is taken in drink. But it is dittany that
is of the greatest efficacy ; it is an emmenagogue, and
forces out the foetus when dead or lying transversely
—an obolus of the leaves is taken in water—being so
efficacious in these respects that it is not even intro-
duced into the bedroom of pregnant women. Not
only when taken in drink but also when used as
embrocation or a fumigation it has medicinal power.
Bastard dittany is very nearly as good, but for an
emmenagogue it 13 boiled down with neat wine, the
