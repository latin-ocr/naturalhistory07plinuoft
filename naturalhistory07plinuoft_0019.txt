INTRODUCTION

point out (1) that identification is often uncertain;
(2) that we rnay know the genus, but not the species
of the plant mentioned, and (3) that aleas is often
both fleshy and glossy.

On the whole, perhaps ‘⁴ fleshy ’' is the best trans-
lation, except in cases where another rendering is
obviously desirable.

Words signifying colours are very troublesome in
the botanical parts of Pliny; niger, candidus, albus,
purpureus, bewilder the translator nearly every time

they* occur.

I have used “ blaek '’ and ‘¹ white '' unless there is
something in the context that makes “ dark ” and
“ light ’⁹ more appropriate3 the comparative nigrior,
for instance, is more likely to be ‘⁴ darker '’ than
‘¹ blacker '’ when applied to leaves or stalks.

Pliny has quite a long section (IX, 124—141) dealing
with purpura. It is plain from this that the colour
referred to was usually a deep red tinged with more
or less blue, our “ purple '' in fact, the most esteemed
variety being like clotted blood. There were many
shades of it, a common one being bright red.

The word purpureus covered a very wide range of
meanings3 Pliny applies it to the violet (XXI, 64),
to plums (XX, 41), to figs (XV, 69) and to lettuce
(probably a form of headed lettuce) (XIX, 126).
The last suggests our ‘¹ brown cos ’⁹ and ‘⁴ continu-
ity.'’ In books XX-XXVII Pliny is mostly trans-
lating Greek, and πορφύρεος seems to be a some—
what wider term than purpureus, which is Pliny's
equivalent. To these elements of uncertainty
must be added the possibility that flowers may
have varied their shades in the last two thousand
