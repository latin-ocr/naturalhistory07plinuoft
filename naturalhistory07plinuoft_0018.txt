INTRODUCTION

foliorum (XXIV ἓξ 47 and 131); foliis exprimitur sucus
(XXIV ἓ 70); fit et foliis sucus (XXIV ξ 109); sucus e
fronde (XXV ἓ 68).

The claims of “ fleshy '⁵ have to be considered.
On the face of it, perhaps, it is a more natural epithet
for leaves than either ‘⁴ glossy '' or ‘¹ juicy‚’' and it is
the only meaning given by Forcellini. Against the
rendering must be put the frequent use of σαρκώδης
by our Greek authorities in this sense, often in close
conjunction with λιπαρός.

In Pliny XXV ἓ 161 occurs a phrase which seems at
first sight to settle the matter. He speaks of
folia . . . carnosa, pinguia} larga suco. Does this
mean “ fleshy, glossy, juicy leaves ”? The last two
epithets, however, may be connected, which would
give the sense: “ rich with copious juice.'' This is
perhaps unlikely, but cannot be ruled out as im-
possible. The parallel passage in Dioscorides (IV
88, 89> does not help in deciding the question.

Hort may be right in translating λιπαρός by
“ glossy,’' but what did Pliny take it to mean when
applied to leaves? A consideration of all the per-
tinent passages suggests a combination of “ glossy ''
and “ fleshy‚'’ i.e., not necessarily large, but “ sleek
and plump.'’ Perhaps, if a single word must be
ehosen to render pinguis whenever it occurs, ‘⁴ rich ''
gets as near to Pliny's idea of the meaning as the
English language will permit. But unfortunately
modern botanists are opposed to this rendering.

It may seem that the best course would be to
identify the leaf referred to, and to vary the trans-
lation to suit the actual facts. Botan1sts, however,

1 Littre translates pinyuia (into the French) “grasses'';
Bostock and Riley “ unctuous.”
