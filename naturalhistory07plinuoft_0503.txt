Appaieutly Pliny here may be localizing the staining
substance. He seems to put it in the filament, the hair-like
part of the stamen that supports the anther.

Summing up we may say that coma means :

(trunk) and branches, i.e. foliage and its appendages;

ADDITIONAL Nora ON XXIV § 166

It is obvious from the phrases pulchros bonosque of this
section and pulchri bonique et fortunati of XXVI ἓ 19, both of
which profess to report Democritus, that Pliny had before
him some case of καλὸς κάγαθός, and that it, or some variant
of it, gives the general sense here. Why the text has been
corrupted, as it obviously has, is a puzzle, for the meaning is
both clear and easy. The reading of Detlefsen and Mayhoff‚
with bonis, is hard to translate, implying that the parents must
be boni. Ι have printed (within daggers) the vulgate text,
which is that of the MS. X. Peihaps the excellentis of the MS.
d is rig ht, and the o1iginal was merely excellentus* (mimi et
formae gWith partum (Mayhoff suggests excellentem for excel-
lentes) understood. Bonos or bonis may be later insertions.

Alternatively‚ formae may be a corruption of formosos or
fortunatos. Improbable as this is, it is less improbable than
the actual corruptions which occurred in a phrase so plain and
so simple.
