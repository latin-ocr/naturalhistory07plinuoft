LIST OF DISEASES

More important for our appreciation of antiquity than the
identification of specific diseases is to ascertain which, if
any, modern diseases were unknown in the Hellenistic age.
Here the evidence, especially that relating to infectious severs,
is most disappointing. These severs are endemic in the
modern world, and figure largely in treatises on pathology.
But the old medical writers—‘⁶ Hippocrates,’³ Celsus, Galen
and the many compilers who succeeded Galen—do not
describe, or give treatment for, smaU-pox‚ chicken-pox,
measles, scarlatffla, typhoid or even influenza. The most that
can be said is that in isolated clinica] histories or in chance
aphoristic remarks one or other of them may be referred to;
the evidence is strongest for diphtheria. Moreover, in the
pseudo-Aristotelian Problems (VII 8) it is said that con-
sumption, ophthalmia and the itch are infectione, but that
severs are not. It is difficult to believe that a people who
knew that consumption is insectious would have called scarla-
tina non-infectione if it had been endemic among them.

The Romans borrowed many names of diseases from the
Greeks. Usually, of course, the Latin word refers to the
same disease as does the Greek, especially 111 the works of
medical writers. But care must be exercised3 λέπρα, for
instance, seems to be much narrower than lepra.

Celsus is by far the most trustworthy authority to follow
in identifying the diseases mentioned by Pliny, for both
were Romans, both (probably) laymen and nearly con-
temporaries.
