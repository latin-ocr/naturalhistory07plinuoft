testicles ; applied in vinegar they turn the hair black.⁰
The same, pounded with twice the quantity of soft
bread and kneaded in Amminean ὸ wine, soothe
pains in the feet and sinews. The globules on this
tree are taken in drink for snake bites or for the
bringing up of blood, and used as an application for
gatherings. Gathered while sost, and pounded with
axle-grease and bean meal, they are also good for
hernia. For the same purpose they are taken in
drink. Mixed with meal they are applied to parotid
tumours and to scrofulous sores. Pounded with the
seed these globules yield a juice, which mixed with
oil takes away films on the eyes. Taken too in doses
of one victoriatus in wine and used as an ointment
with a rich dried fig, from which the seeds have been
removed, it cures affections of the testicles, disperses
tumours‚ and with leaven heals scrofulous sores.
Cypress root, pounded with the leaves and taken in
drink, cures affections of the bladder and strangury,
and counteracts the poison of spiders. The shavings
taken in drink act as an emmenagogue, and neutra-
lize the stings of scorpions.

XI. The big cedrus, which they call cedrelate‚⁰
yields a pitch which is called cedria, very useful for
toothache3 for it breaks the teeth and brings them
out, easing the pain. I have already described d how
cedrus juice is extracted from the wood, of great use
for book-rolls ‘2 were it not for the headache it causes.

ε The reading (volumina) of the great majority of the MSS.
is slightly confirmed by Pliny’s speaking in the context of the
preserving qualities of cedar resin. The headache apparently
is that said to be given to those using the rolls for writing or
reading. Detlefsen's collyria would be moro attractive were
cedria among the ingrediente of Celsus* prescriptions (VI. Vi.
M 2 ff) for eye salves. Lumina (tapers, torches) is possible.
