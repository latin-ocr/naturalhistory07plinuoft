boil it down until the water becomes sweet, pour
this off, pound the root, and work it into lozenges‚
which they dry in the sun and use afterwards for sores
on the head and all other ailments that call for a deter-
gent. Moreover‚ they give in wine a three-finger
pinch for cough, and an electuary made of it for
pleurisy or pneumonia. They also give it to be taken
in wine for sciatica, for colic, and as an emmenagogue.

XCIII. Peplis, called by some syce, by others
meconion or mecon aphrodes, grows into a shrub
from one slender root, and has leaves like those of
rue but a little broader. Under the leaves is a round
seed, smaller than that of the white poppy. It is
gene1 ally ‹rathered among vines at harvest time, and
is dried with its seed after a vessel has been placed
beneath to catch this. Taken in drink it relaxes the
bowels‚ bringing away bile and phlegm. A moderate
dose is an acetabulum in three heminae of hydromel.
It is sprinkled over foods and relishes to loosen the
bowels.

XCIV. Periclymenon too is a plant which grows
into 3 shrub‚ having after an interval two leaves
which are whitish and soft. And at the top among
the leaves is a seed which is hard, and difficult to
pluck.‘¹ The plant grows in cultivated fields and in
hedges, climbing round supports of any kind. Its
seed is dried in the shade, pounded‚ and worked up

this passage, it seems to me that Pliny in condensing probably
omitted a description of the flower-head aster fruticat. There
is one odd feature os the genus Lonsicera. Quite a few of the
species have a flower growing on an axillary bracted peduncle.
A little below the flower-head (ex intervallo) there are two pairs
of these bracts, so conjoined that each seems to be a single
leaf. This is a fairly distinctive feature, one likely to be noted
for purposes of recognition.” (A.C.A.)
