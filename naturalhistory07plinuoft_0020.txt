INTRODUCTION

yearS‚ so that modern plants are not an infallible
guide.

On the whole it seems best to keep ‘⁴ purple ’⁹
(Littre has regularly “ pourpre '') unless the context
shows that such a rendering is impossible or absurd.

Vero in Pliny is often neither intensive nor ad-
versative, neither ‘¹ indeed ’' nor “ however‚'’ but
almost a mere connective particle equivalent ‘co item.
Sometimes, but by no means always, it introduces a
climax. Usually, however, a slight, generally a very
slight, adversative force remains, and I have always
tried “ however ” and “ indeed '’ before falling back
on a purely connective word.

Oleum, translated “ oil‚'’ was usually, perhaps
always, olive oil. &Vhen another kind of oil is
indicated an epithet is added.

The Latin names of plants have been kept unless to
do so would be absurd3 I write for instance sideritis
and ageraton, but “ rose '' and “ plantain.’' In other
words, English names are used only when they are
familiar and also correct identifications. The Index
of Plants should clear up most of the difficulties
that may occur.
