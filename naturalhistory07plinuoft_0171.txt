when snakes begin to cast thei1 slough it springs up
to the height of about two feet, and then buries itself
in the ground when snakes do so, and while it is con-

water. To drink it caused within two years the

plant called britannica, which is good not only for
the sinews and for diseases of the mouth, but also
for the relief of quinsy and snake-bite. It has dark,
rather long⁶ leaves, and a dark root. Its juice is
extracted even from the root. The blossom is called
vibones; gathered before thunder is heard and
swallow ed, it keeps away the fear of quinsy for a
whole year. It was pointed out to our men by the
Frisians, at that time a loyal tiibe, in whose terri-
tory our camp lay. Why the plant was so called Ι
greatly wonder, unless perhaps, living on the shore of
the British ocean, they have so named the britannica
because it is, as it were, a near neighbour of Britain.‘²
It is certain that the plant was not so named because
it grew abundantly in that island: Britain was at
that time an independent state.
