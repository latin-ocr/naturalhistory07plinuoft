BOOK XXV. LI. 91-L111. 93

LI. Dogs too have found a plant by which they Plants soum!
cure loss of appetite, and eat it in our sight, but in ⁶⁹ ‘¹⁰⁹⁸'
such a way that it can never be identified, for it is
seen only when chewed up. This animal shows yet
greater spitefulness in its secrecy about another
plant3 for there is one by which it is said to cure itself
when bitten by a snake, but it does not crop it when
a human being is looking on.

LII. With greater frankness deer have shown us Plantssozmd
elaphoboscon, about which we have written,‘² and by dm·

bryony, as we have pointed out b 3 (LIII.) dittany also
by feeding on it when wounded, the weapons at once
falling out.c The latter grows nowhere except in
Crete, with branches very slender3 it resembles
pennyroyal and is burning and harsh to the taste.

Only the leaves are employed3 it has no flower, no
seed and no stem3 its root is slender and without
medicinal value. Even in Crete it does not grow
widely, and the goats are wonderfully eager to hunt it
out. A substitute for it is false dittany, which
grows in many lands, like true dittany in leaf but
with smaller branches, and called by some chondris.

vere percussi eo telo pastuque herbae eius eiecto. A scribe
with an aural memory of XXII. §41 may have had it suggested
to him by the similarity of dictam to etiamnum with dictamnum
following a little later. Seselin is sufficiently like helxinen to
the eye to set in motion latent aural mcmory, and the other
change, the omission of a connecting particle before dictamnum,
would follow naturally. Hermolaus Barbarus in 1492 saw
that some restoration of the text was necessary, and would
delete ‹lic-summam before vulneratae and emend dictam to
dictamnum. Whatever the details of the correct emendation
may be, the corruption took place very early, before the
archetype of our existing MSS. was written, as none of them has
any sign that helxincm) and dictam are wrong.
