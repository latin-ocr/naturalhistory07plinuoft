said to become thereby more excited sexually. The
remarks on this subject made by Theophrastus‚a
generally a weighty authority, are fabulous. He
says that the lust to have intercourse seventy times
in succession has been given by the touch of a certain
plant whose name and kind he has not mentioned.

reduces varicose veins and does its work without
pain. Gout was a rarer disease within the memory,
not only of our fathers and grandfathers, but also
of our own generation. It is also itself a foreign
complaint3 had it existed in Italy in early times it
would have received a Latin name. It must not be
considered incurable‚ for many cases have been
cured without treatment, and yet more with it.
Useful remedies are roots of panaces with misius,
juice of henbane with meal, or the seed of henbane,
scordion in vinegar, hiberis as already prescribed‚²'
vervain beaten up with axle-grease, and the root of
cyclamen, a decoction of which is also good for
chilblains. Cooling applications for gouty pains are
made from xiphion root, psyllion seed, hemlock with
litharge or axle-grease‚ and aizoiim for the first onset
of red, that is hot, gout. Good for either kind how-
ever is erigeron with axle-grease‚ plantain leaves
beaten up with a little salt added, and argemonia
pounded with honey. Vervain too may be applied as
a remedy—or the feet may be soaked in the water
in which it has been boiled—LXV. or the lappago
that is like anag-allis, but more branchy and leafy,
and with a strong smell. This kind of plant⁶ is

one kind of Iappayo, and I feel certain that the hiatus of 76
letters after qravis in E once contained a description of a plant
to which talis refers.
