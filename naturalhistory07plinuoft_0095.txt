LXI. Sabine herb, called brathy by the Greeks, is of Nae-in.
two kinds. One has a leaf like that of the tamarisk,
the other like that of the cypress, for which reason
some have called it the Cretan cypr-ess. Many use it
instead of frankincense for fumigations 3 in medicines
rnoreover a double dose is said to be equivalent in
strength to a single dose of cinnamon. It reduces
gatherings and checks corroding sores 3 an application
cleanses ulcers, and used as a pessary or for fumigation
it brings away the dead foetus. With honey it is used
as an ointment for erysipelas and carbuncles; taken
in wine it cures jaundice. By fumigation sabine herb
is said to eure the pip in chickens.

LXII. Like this sabine herb is the plant called selago Selaqo-
It is gathered without iron with the right hand, thrust
under the tunic through the left arm-hoie, as though
the gatherer were thieving.‘¹ He should be clad in
white, and have bare feet washed clean; before
gathering he should make a sacrificial offering of
bread and wine. The plant is carried in a new napkin.
The Druids of Gaul have recorded that it should be
kept on the person to ward off all fatalities, and that
the snioke of it is good for all diseases of the eyes.

LXIII. The same authorities have called samolus Satnolus.
(brook-weed) a plant growing in moist 1·egions‚b
which (they say) is to be gathered with the left hand
here the right hand pretends to be the left and deceives the
plant, taking it by surprise before its virtue can slip away.
Such deeeption of (3.9. rice is still common in the East.
Mayhoff's text gives: ‘⁴ the right hand being covered by the
tunic, it is torn off by the left hand etc.”

²³ I think that el before hanc is ‘⁶ and ” not ‘⁸ also.'' The
latter meaning would make necessary a radieal reconstruetion
of ἓ 103. But there seem to be contrasts between the two cases,

dextra)(sinislra and sacro facto pane vinoque)(a ieiunis. One is
tempted to suggest at for et.
