draught. Henbane crushed with the leaves on is
given in wine, especially for the poison of asps.

LIX. No plant however is so renowned among the Hiera boe<
Romans as hiera botane (“ sacred plant ''). Some call
it asistereon, and Latin writers verbenaca. This is
the plant which I mentioned as carried to the enemy
by envoys.a With this the table of Jupiter is swept,⁰
and homes are cleansed and purified. There are two
kinds of it 3 one has many leaves and is thought to be
female, the other, the male, has fewer leaves. Each
kind has several sprigs that are slender, a cubit long
and angular; the leaves are smaller and narrower
than those of the oak3 the indentations 100 316
deeper, the blossom is grey, and the root long and
slender. It grows everywhere in flat, moist localities.
Some authorities do not distinguish these two kinds
but make of them one only, since both have the same
properties. Both kinds are used by 1116 people of
Gaul in fortune-telling and in uttering prophecies, but
the Magi especially make the maddest statements
about the plant: that people who have been rubbed
with it obtain their wishes, banish fevers‚⁰ 11111
friends and cure all diseases without exception.
They add that it must be gathered about the rising of
1116 Dog—star without the action being seen by moon
or sun3 that beforehand atonement must be made
10 Ε31111 by an offering of honey-comb and honey3
that 3 611616 1111131 be drawn with 11011 round the plant
and then it should be pulled up with the left hand and
raised aloft3 that leaves, stem and root must be
dried separately in the shade. They say too that
if a dining-couch is sprinkled with water in which

that a plant cures severs. The madness lies in believing that
anointed persons have magical powers.
