BOOK XXIV. LI. 88-L1v. 91

LI. Akin to the reed is a plant growing in Egypt, papyrus.
the papyrus, which, when it has been dried, is especi-
ally useful for expanding and drying fistulas, and, by
swelling‚ for opening them to admit medicaments.
The paper made from it is, when bui-nt, one of the
caustic remedies. Its ash taken in wine induces
sleep. The planta itself applied with water cures
callosities.

LII. Not even in Egypt does the ebony-tree grow, Ebony.
as I have stated,²' and in my medical research I omit
foreign regions3 yet I must not pass it by, as it is a
great marvel. Its sawdust is said to be a sovereign
remedy for the eyes; its wood, ground on the whet-
stone and mixed with raisin wine, to dispel dimness of
vision; its root, applied however in water, to dis-
perse white specks on the eyes3 cough too to be
cleared away if an equa] measure of dracunculus
root is added along with honey Physicians include
ebony among erosive remedies.

LIII. The rhododendmsc has not even found aOleander.
Latin name among the Romans, names for it being
rhododaphne⁶ or nerium.c It is a strange fact that,
while its leaves are poisonous to quadrupeds‚ to man
on the other hand, if rue is added and the mixture
taken in wine, they are a protection against the
poison of snakes. Sheep too and goats, if they drink
water in which these leaves have been steeped, are
said to be killed by it.

LIV. Neither has rhus received a Latin name, [ellus.
although many uses are made of it. For it is both a
wild plant with myrtle—like leaves and short stems‚
which expels tapeworms, and also the shrub called

{iescxiibed by Dioscorides (IV. 81, Wellmann). See Indeoe of
