by cabbage and frankincense with frequent draughts
of hot water3 or the ash from a burning coala ex-
tinguished in the patient’s presence may be picked
up with a finger and applied. Other remedies are
pounded plantain and tithymallus cliaracites.
LXXIII. Remedies for dropsy are: panaces ;
plantain as food, after dry bread without any drink3
two-drachma doses of betony in two cyathi of wine
or honey wine; agaric, or lonchitis seed, two spoon-
fuls for a dose taken in water3 psyllion in wine;
juice of either anagallis3 root of cotyledon in honey
wine; root of fresh ebulum, shaken only and not
washed, a two-finger pinch for a dose, taken in a
hemina of old wine and hot water3 root of trefoil in
wine, two drachmae for a dose3 the tithymallus
called platyphyllon; seed of the hypericum known
as caros ; acte, which some identify with ebulum, the
root, if there is no sever, being crushed in three
cyathi of wine, or the seed b being· taken in dark
wine; vervain also, a good handful being boiled
down in water to one half. The most efficacious
remedy however is believed to be the juice of
chamaeacte. An outbreak ⁶ of phlegm is relieved by
plantain, by cyclamen root in honey, and by pounded
leaves of ebulum in old wine. An application of the
last cures boad also, an eruption of red pimples‚ and
the juice of strychnos applied as liniment cures itch.

‘' See list of diseases. Here perhaps nasal catarrh‚ but else-
where (XXV § 61) pituitous eruptions on the body.

¹² The Latin Thesaurus gives a full list of references to boa,
which was the name of more than one complaint. In Pliny it
means some kind of eczema. The name was supposed to be
connected with bos, because ox dung was used as a remedy.
