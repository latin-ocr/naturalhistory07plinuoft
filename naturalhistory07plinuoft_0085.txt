BOOK XXIV. L. 85—87

L. Ι have pointed out α twenty-eight kinds of reed, leeeds.
and nowhere is more obvious that force of Nature
which I describe in these books one after an-
other, if indeed tlie root of the reed, crushed
and applied, draws a fern stem out of the flesh,
while the root of the fern does the same to a splinter
of reed. To increase the number of the various
reeds there is that which grows in ,Iudaea and Syria and
is used for scents and unguents ;boiled down with grass
or celery seed this is diuretie, and when made into
a pessary acts as an emmenagogue. A cure for
sprains, for troubles of the liver and of the kid-
neys, and for dropsy, is two oboli taken in drink3
for a cough also inhalation is used, the addition of
resin being an improvement3 for scurf and running
sores is used a decoction with myrrh. Its juice also
is collected and made into a drug like elaterium.
Of all reeds the parts nearest the root are the
most efficacious‚ and the joints are more efficacious ¹²
than other parts. The Cyprian reed, called donax,
has a bark which, reduced to ash‚ is a reinedy for
mange and also for festering sores. Its leaves are
used for extracting splinters, and are also good for
erysipelas and for all gatherings. The common reed
has the power to extract if freshly pounded, and not
the root only, for many hold that the reed itself
too has this property. The root applied in vinegar
cures dislocations and pains of the spine3 the same
ground fresh and taken in wine is aphrodisiac. The
down on reeds placed in the ears deadens the
hearing.

‘² See XVI. § 156 ff.
²² Another possible rendering is “ the parts nearest the root,
are very efficacious and the joints are more efficacious still.'’
