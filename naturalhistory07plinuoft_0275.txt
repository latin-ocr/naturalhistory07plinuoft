decoction in wine or vinegar used as a mouth-wash,
and also that of the root of cinquefoil boiled

and the decoction should be kept in the mouth for

Some have said that it has the leaves of rocket,
others of the oak but much smaller; some that the
root is useless, others that it is good for the sinews,
others that it chokes if taken in drink. On the other
