brilliant enough for success in other professions‚
suddenly abandoned rhetoric for medicine.‘¹ A man
who neither had practised it nor knew anything
of remedies that call for sharp eyes and personal
experience, but could attract by his eloquent and
daily-practised oratory, was forced to reject all
simples, and reducing the whole of medicine to the
discovery of causes, made it a matter of guess-
work. He recognised especially five principles of
general application: fasting from food, in other
cases abstinence from wine, massage, walking‚ and
the various kinds of carriage-rides. Since every
man realised that he could provide these things
for himself, and since all applaudedb him as if
the easiest things were also true, Asclepiades
brought round to his view almost all the human
race, just as if he had been sent as an apostle from
heaven.

VIII. He used, moreover‚ to attract men’s minds
by the empty artifice ⁰ of promising the sick, now
wine, which he administered as opportunity occurred,
while now he would prescribe cold water3 and since
Herophilus had anticipated him in inquiring into the
causes of diseases, and Cleophantus among the
ancient physicians had brought to prominent notice
the treatment by wine, he preferred, according to
Marcus Varro, to win for himself the surname of
“ cold—water giver.'' ‘² He devised also other attrac-

corrupted to animalia. Personally I thought for a time that
amabili (“ alluring ²⁷) might be right, and friends have sug-
gested anili (“ old woman's trick ’Ἴ and animae (‘⁴ psycho-
logical trick ”). Perhaps promittendo is “by prescribing.'’
See XXIV ἓ 80.

¹¹ Asclepiades was actually nicknamed ‘⁴ wine-giver.” See
