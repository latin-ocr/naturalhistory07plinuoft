in milk of the roots of cinquefoil‚ or aristolochia,
a victoriatus by weight in three cyathi of wine.
When the prescriptions mentioned above are to be
taken warin, it will be found best to heat them
with red-hot iron. On the other hand a drachma
of the juice of the lesser centaury taken in a hemina
of water with a little salt and vinegar purges the
bowels and carries off bile3‘2 the greater centaury
dispels griping pains. Betony acts as an aperient,
four drachmae being added to nine cyathi ofhydrome13
so also euphorbeum or agai-ic, in doses of two
drachmae xw'th a little salt, taken in water or in three
oboli of honey wine. Cyclamen too is an aperient,
either taken in water or used as a suppository; the
same in its action is a suppository of chamaecissos
A handful of hyssop, boiled down to one third with
salt, or pounded in oxymel and salt, both carries off
phlegm and expels worms from the intestines. Root
of peucedanum carries off both phlegm and bile.

XXXV. Both kinds of anagallis, taken in hydromel,
are purgative, as is also epithymum, which is the
blossom of the thyme like satureia. The only differ-
ence is that this has a grass—green flower‚ the other
thyme a white one. Some call it hippopheos. Less
beneficia] to the stomach, it causes vomitings, but
dispels colio and flatulence. As an electuary it is
also taken with honey, and sometimes with iris, for
chest troubles. From four to six drachmae with
honey and a little salt and vinegar move the bowels.
Others give a different account of epithymum: that
it grows without a root, has a small head like a little
hood, is red in colour and is dried in the shade‚ and a
dose of half an acetabulum, taken in water, carries
off phlegm and bile, acting as a gentle aperient.
