doses of two cyathi, before the paroxysms of agnes,
especially tertiari and quartan, also for cholera, dysen-
tery and a relaxed stomach. The third kind, called
orion, grows on mountains and is like a tender reed.
It has one stem with knots close together and fitted
one into another-,⁰ leaves resembling those of the
pitch pine, and a root of no medicina] use. This kind
is less efficacious than those already mentioned, and
used especiallyb for sciatica. The fourth kind is
called wild polygonum, a shrub that is almost a tree3
it has a ligneous root, a red trunk like that of the
cedar, branches like those of spartum, two spans long,
and with three or four dark, knotted joints. This
kind too is of an astringent ⁶ nature, and tastes like a
quince. It is boiled down in water to one third, or
dried and powdered for sprinkling on ulcerations of
the mouth and excoriated bruises, but for sore gums
the plant itselfis chewed. It ari-ests corrosive ulcers,
and all those that spread or are slow to heal; for
frost-bite however it is specific. Herbalists also use
it for quinsy3 for headache they make a chaplet of
it which they place on the head; while to cure eye
fluxes they put one round the neck. For tertiari
ague some d pluck it with the left hand and attach it
as an amulet, and for haemorrhage also. There is no
other plant that they keep in a dry state more than
they do polygonum.

XCII. Pancratium some prefer to call “ little
squill.'' It has leaves resembling those of the white
lily, but longer and thicker‚ and a root like a large,
red bulb. Its juice taken with vetch flour relaxes
the bowels and cleanse ulcers. With honey it is
given for dropsy and affectione· of the spleen. Others
