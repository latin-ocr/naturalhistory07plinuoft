for wounds.“ Lysimachia is good treatment for
fresh wounds,b and plantain for ulcers of all kinds,
especially for those of old men and babies. It is better
when softened by fire, and with wax-salve cleanses
the thickened lips of ulcers and arrests corrosive
sores. The pounded plant when applied should be
601 ered with its own leaves Suppur ations, gathei-
ings and pitted ulcers are also d1ied up by chelidonia,
w ounds aie he aled so well that it is even used instead
ofspodium. It is also applied with axle-grease to
sores that are already despaired of. Dittany taken
in drink forces out arrows3 an external application
causes to fall out other kinds of weapons—-the dose
for a draught is an obolus of the leaves in a
cyathus of water—and bastard dittany is almost as
effective3 both too disperse suppurations. Aristo-
lochia also eats away festering 1110615, with honey
cleanses those that are foul, expels worms, the
callosities also that f01m in ulcers and all things
embedded in the flesh‚ especially with resin arrows
and bone splinters; but the pits of ulcers it fills
up by itself or with the addition of iris. For fresh
wounds it is used in vinegar3 for chronic ulcers
vervain is used, or cinquefoil with salt and honey.
The roots of persollata are applied to fresh wounds
that have been inflicted by 11011, and the leaves
to old munds, axle-grease being added to bothc
with a covering of the plant’s leavesst Other
applications are damasonium, used as for scrofula, and
the leaves of verbascum in vinegar or wine. Peris-

them is an impositum. So rather reluctantly I have not adopted
this brilliant attempt to restore the true text.
