BOOK XXV. 111. 6-1v. 8

they lived on poison 3 addressed to him were treatises‚
still extant, written by the famous physician Asclepi-
ades, who when urgently invited to come from Rome
sent instructions instead ; Mithridates alone ofmen is
definitely known to have spoken twenty-two langu-
ages, and no man of his subject peoples was ever
addressed by him through an interpreter during
all the fifty-six years of his reign. He then, with
his brilliant intellect and wide interests, was an
especially diligent student of medicine, and col-
lected detailed knowledge from all his subjects, who
comprised a great part of the world, leaving among
his private possessions a bookcase of these treatises
with specimens and the properties of each. Pompeius
however on getting possession of all the royal booty
ordered his freedman Lenaeus, a man of letters, to
translate these into Latin. This great victory
therefore was as beneficent to life as it was to the
State.

IV. Besides these the subject has been treated
by Greek writers, whom we have mentioned in their
proper places; of these, Crateuas, Dionysius and
Metrodorus adopted a most attractive method,
though one which makes clear little else except the
difficulty of employing it. For they painted like-
nesses of the plants and then wrote under them
their propertieS. But not only is a picture mis-
leading when the colours are so many, particularly
as the aim is to copy Nature, but besides this, much
imperfection arises from the manifold hazards in the
accuracy α of copyists. In addition, it is not enough
for each plant to be painted at one period only of
its life, since it alters its appearance with the
fourfold changes of the year.
