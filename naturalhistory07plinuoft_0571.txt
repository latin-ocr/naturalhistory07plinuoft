LIST OF DISEASES

haps also some form of eczema
or lupus. Also = shingles.

Heus—Severe colio. Possibly
appendicitis was included
under this term.

Impettqo.—Tha Romans used
this term of various kinds of
eczema. Celsus (V 28, 17)
mentions four, the last being
incurable.

Impetzcs.-—Inflammation or an
inflamed swelling; Pliny has
impetus oculorum. With the
genitive of a word meaning
a specific disease it denotes
an attack of it.

I⁷1teo·tri90.—Chafing‚ especially
between the legs.

Isclzias.—Sciatica.

Laterum dolon—‘⁶ Severe pain
in the side,'' nearly always
pleurisy.

Lentiqo.——Freckles.

Leptae.-—Seems to be used of
any scaly disease of the skin;
Pliny gives cures. There was
a kind regarded as incurable,
but this is not mentioned by
Pliny, who has forty-six
references, all to cures.

Letharqus (letharyia).--In Hip·
pocrates probably the coma-
tose form of pernicious ma-
laria, but later perhaps also
prolonged coma of any kind.

[sichem-This is said by Pliny
(XXVI 2-4) to be a new
disease to Italy, usually
beginning on the chin. Hence
the name mentayra (chin
disease). Littrc diagnoses it as
leprosy, but Pliny says (XXVI
§ l) sine dolore quidem illos, ac
sine pernicie vitae. This etate-
ment, as Pliny puts it, applies
also to carbunculus and
elephantiasis, but Pliny's own

account of these diseases is
quite inconsistent with sine
pernicie. So Pliny‘s remark
is carelessly inaccurate, 01·
applies only to lichenes.

[sippzsstudo.—1nflammati0n of the
eye, generally ophthalmia.

Luxata.—Disloeations.

Illalandria.—Pustules on the
neck.

Melancholiczw.—One suffering
from melancholia, which in-
cluded malarial cachexia and
many melancholic eonditions,
even mere nervousness. In
fact it included any disease
supposed to be caused by
“ black bile '' (μέλαινα χολή).

Me21ta9ra.—In XXVI 2 called
a lichen beginning on the
chin. See lichen.

Nome (pl. nomam-A spreading
ulcer, much the same as
ulcus serpem.

Nubecula.-—A cloudy film on
the eye, sometimes cataract.

Nyctalops.—One afflicted with
night blindness.

Opisthotonus.—The form of
tetanus in which the body
curves backwards.

Orthopnoea.·—Serious
when the patient cannot
breathe unless upright.

ParzuS.—Spencer in a note on
Celsus V 18, 19 calls this a
‘⁴ superficial abscess in a
hair follicle.'' It occurred
chiefly on the scalp, on the
groin and under the arm.

Paronychia (-um).—Whitlow.

Parotis.——A swelling of the
glands by the ears. Some
