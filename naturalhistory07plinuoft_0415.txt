view that aconite is also a very health—giving in-
gredient of preparations for the eyes, openly declaring
their belief that no evila at all is without some ad-
mixture of good. It will therefore be right for me,
who have described no poiseus, to point out the
nature of aconite, if only for the purpose of detecting
it. It has leaves like those of cyclamen or of
cucumber, not more than four, rising from the root
and slightly bairy, and a root of moderate size‚ like

a crayfish (cammarus), whence some have called it

cammaron, and others thelyphonon, for the reason I
have given already. The end of the root curves up a
little like a scorpion's fail, whence some have called it
also scorpion. There have been some who would
prefer to call it myoctonosss’ since at a distance, even a
long distance, its smell kills rats and mice. The plant
grows on bare crags which are called cleonae, and for
that reason some have given it the name of ammte,
there being nothing near, not even dust,⁶ to give it
nourishment. This then is the reason for its name
given by some3 others have thought it was so
named because it had the same power to cause rapid
death as whetstonesd had to give an edge to an iron
blade ; no sooner was the stone applied than its rapid
action was no'ciceable.e

III. Aethiopis has leaves like those of phlomos,
large, numerous and hairy, growing from the root.
The stem is quadrangular, rough, like that of arction

wuda radicis incurvatur paulum scorpionum modo. The phrase
cauda radicis is peculiar, and suggests that Pliny had a Greek
text before him in which ῥίζα and οὐρὰ (or some case of it) were
side by side. There is nothing in Dioscorides corresponding to
arida, which appears to have arisen from its partial likeness to
rauda.
