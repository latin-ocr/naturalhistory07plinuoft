BOOK XXV. xxx1x. 8o-xm1. 82

XXXIX. The physician Themiso too has spread
the fame of a common plant, the plantain, having
published a treatise about it as though he were the
discoverer. There are two kinds of it: the smaHer,
with narrower and darker leaves, resembles the
tongue ofa sheep; the stem is angular and bends
downward. It grows in meadows. The other kind
is larger and enclosed with leaves as it were m‘th
sides. Since these leaves are seven in number the
plant is sometimes called heptapleuron. The stem
too of this is a cubit high; when α it grows on wet
soils it is much more efficacious. It has a wonderful
power to dry and brace the body, having a cauterizing
property. There is nothing that checks so well the
fluxes called by the Greeks rheumatismoi, that is,
catarrhs.

XL. Akin to the plantain is buglossos, which is
like the tongue of an ox. The most conspicuous
quality of this is that thrown into wine it increases the
exhilarating effect, and so it is also called euphro-
synum, the plant that cheers.

XLI. Akin too is cyiioglosso8‚ which is like a dog's
tongue, and a most attractive addition to ornamental
gai-dens. It is said that the root of the kind with
three seed-bearing stems, if taken in water, is good
for tertians, and that with four for quartans. There
is also another plant like this which bears tiny burs.
Its root taken in water neutralizes the poison of
frogs b and snakes.

XLII. Another plant is buphthalmus, which is like
the eyes of oxen‚ having leaves like those of fennel,
a bushy plant growing around towns, with⁶ . .
