LXII. But very high on 1116 1131 of wonders is the
plant orchis, or serapias, which has the leaves of
leek, a stem 3 span high, and a purple flower.
The root 1133 two tubers, like testicles, so that the
larger‚ or, as some put it, the thimei-‚⁰ taken in
water excites desire3 the smaller‚ or softer, taken in
goat’s milk checks it. Some say that this orchis 1135
leaves like those of the squill‚ only smoother and
smaller, and a prickly stem. The roots cure sores
in the mouth and phlegm on the chest3 taken in
wine they are constipating. Satyrion is a sexual
stimulant. There are two kinds of it: one with
longer leaves than those of the olive, a stem four
fingers high, purple blossom, and 3 double root
shaped like human testicles, which swells and sub-
sides again in alternate years. The other kind has
the further name of satyrios orchis, and is thought
to be 16111316.ὸ Ι1 13 distinguished from the former
kind by the spaces between the joints, by its more
branchy, bushy shape ⁶ 3 also by its root's being like a
phallus.d The plant is generally found near the sea.

⁶ Or, ‘⁴ by its stem's having many branches.” The word
frutex sometimes z caulis, but herc I think it means the
“ skeleton ” as it were of a small busli or shrub.

‘² To judge from Mayhoff’s critical note the MS. E has
fascini-5, the vulgate before Sillig fascinis utili, and the other
MSS. (radice) fascini. The meaning is surely that the root
is not, like the former kind, ad formam hominis testium, but
like a phallus. So the Latin Thesaurus. I think, however,
that 1116 MSS. reading, retained without comment by both
Detlefsen and Mayhoff, can scarcely be quite right. Perhaps
we should add simili, which would explain the fascinis utile of
the vulgate, fascini simili being not very unlike sascinis utili.
It is strange that this account of satyrion should appear here,
just before the chapter (LXIII) in which that plant is
described. Commentators think that Pliny has been con-
