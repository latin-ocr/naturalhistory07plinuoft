BOOK XXIV. ΧΗ. 20-X111. 22

XII. Cedrides, that is the fruit of the cedrus, cure Fran os mc
a cough, are diuretiC, arrest looseness of the bowels‚ mm·
and are useful for ruptures, sprains, spasms, strangury
and uterine affections‚ forming an ingredient of anti-
dotes a for the poison of sea hares and those poisons
mentioned above‚²⁷ and being used for gatherings
and inflammations.

XIII. About galbanum I have already spoken.⁶ Galbanum-
The best kind is considered to be that which is neither
moist nor dry, and such as Ι have indicated. It is
taken in drink by itself for chronic cough‚ asthma,
rnptures and sprains3 it is used as an application for
sciatica, pains in the sides, superficial abscesses, boiis,
separation of flesh fron] bones, scrofulous sores, knotty
lumps at the joints‚ and tooth-ache. With lioney too
it makes an ointnient for sores on the head. With
rose oil or nard it is inj ected for pus in the ears. Its
smell is beneficia] for epilepsy, choking of the uterus,
and for weaknessd of the stomach. A pessary or
fumigation brings away the foetus when there is a
miscarriage, and so will a branch ofhellebore smeared
with it and laid under the woman. I have said that
snakes are kept off by the fumes caused by burning·
it3⁶2 they do not come either near persons rubbed
with galbanum. It heals also scorpion stings. A

however, Dioscorides lias μείγνυνται δὲ καὶ ἀντιδότοις, which
makes Jan’s restoration slightly the. most preferable.

ὸ The phrase euclem quae supra is vagno, and it seems hope-
less to try to identify euclem.

⁶ See XII. ἓ 126.

‘² Cf. XIX. §92‚ desectus praecipue stomachi excitat. A
favourite word of Pliny, defectus seems to mean the failure to
function of any organ.

⁶ The activo urentium is odd, but the meaning is certain,
for XII. §126 has sincerum si uratur fuya! nidore serpenles.
