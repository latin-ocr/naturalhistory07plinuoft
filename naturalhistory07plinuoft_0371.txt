BOOK XXVI. Lxx. 113—Lxxl. 116

oxymel‚⁰ leaves of cinquefoil in water, and also
archezostiS‚ but the last must be taken in drink for
a year. Other cures are dried root of baccar crushed
to powder and taken in hot water in doses of three
cyathi with one of coriander, pounded centunculus
in vinegar or honey or hot water‚²’ vervain taken in
wine, three crushed berries of hyssop taken in water
for sixteen days, equal quantities of peucedanum
and seal's rennet taken in drink, crushed leaves of
cinquefoil taken in wine for thirty days, powdered
betony in doses of three denarii by weight with a
cyathus of squill vinegar and an ounce of Attic
honey‚⁶ scammony in doses ἆ of two oboli with four
drachmae of beaver-oil.

LXXI. The chills of fever are relieved by agaric
taken in hot water, tertian severs by sideritis with
oil‚ by crushed ladanum, a plant found in grain fields,
by plantain in hydromel taken in two—drachma doses
within two hours before a paroxysm, juice of its root
soal-:ed or pounded, or by the root itself beaten up in
water θ heated with hot iron. Some physicians
have prescribed doses of three roots in three cyathi
of water, changing three to four if the sever is
qual-tan. If one takes, when bugloss is withering,

menting that Pliny seems to say : “ Yes, archezostis does cure,
but it takes a long time.''

ὓ It is often difficult to see whether in such phrases the
adverbial expression goes with the participle tritus or not.
Here for instance the Bohn translators have “ bruised in
vinegar.’' See note ἓ 115.

⁰ I take uncia to be ablative with cum understood, but as
sar as the grammar is conoerned, mellis Attici uncia might
be a new remedy‚ with uncia nominative.

‘¹ Littre translates as I do, but the Bohn translators think
that the numbers refer to the proportions of the prescription.

⁶ Perhaps, “ pounded root itself in water etc.‘’
