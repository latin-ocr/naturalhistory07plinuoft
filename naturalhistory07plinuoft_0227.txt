BOOK XXV. LIV. 95-97

‘tinguishing four kinds of it: one with round tubers
on the root, and with leaves partly like those of the
mallow and partly like those of 1vy‚ but darker and
softer: the second IS the male plant, a with a long root
of four finger's length, thick as a w alking- -stick; the
third is very long nand as slender as a young vine,
with especially strong properties, and is called by
some clematitis and by other cretica. All kinds of
this plant are of the colour of boxwood, and have
small stems and purple blossom. They bear small
berries like caper bei-ries. Only the root has medi-
cinal value. There is also a fourth kind, called
plistolochia, more slender than the one last mentioned,
with dense, hair-like masses for a root, and of the
thickness of a stoutish rush, which some surname
polyrrhizos. All kinds have a drug-like smell, but
that of the rather long ⁶ and slender root is more
agreeable3 its fleshy outer skin in fact is even
suitable for nard ointmentS. These plants grow
on plains with a rich soil. The time to dig them up
is at harvest3 the earth is scraped off them before
they are stored away.⁶ The most valued root, how-
ever, comes from Pontus, and in every case the
heaviest specimens are preferred3 for medicines the
round is more suitable, for snake bites the longer

hard to reconcile the phrase just quoted with Pliny's des-
cription of clematitis in § 95.

⁶ Mayhoff’s emendation would mean: “they are stored
away in earth seraped off them”. He says in a note on
XIX. ξ 115 (vol. III p. 495) that in is generally used with
servare in this sense. If this restoration is correct, the im-
plication is that the roots keep better in the earth in which
they are grown. On the whole I prefer to follow Detlefsen.
To clean the roots might help to keep pure the odor medi-
catus.
