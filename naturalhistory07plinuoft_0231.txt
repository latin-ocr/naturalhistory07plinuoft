The smell too of lysimachia keeps snakes away.
Those who have been bitten are given chelidonia in
wine, and to the bites is applied in particular betony,
the power of which is said to be so great that snakes
enclosed-in a circle of it lash themselves to death.
For the bites is given its seed, the dose being a
denarius with three cyathi of wine, or else it is
ground and three drachmae of the powder are given
in a sextarius of water3 the powder is also applied
locally. Cantabrica too is used, and dittany, and
aristolochia, a drachma of the root in a hemina of
wine, but the dose must be repeated several times.
Aristolochia in vinegar also makes a useful applica-
tion, and so does plistolochia, in fact the mere hanging
of this above the hearth makes all snakes hurry
from the house. LVI. Argemonia too is good, a
denarius of its root being taken in three cyathi of
wine. It is proper for more details to be given about
this plant, and about the others, when the first
mention is made of them, and the first mention of
each should be when Ι deal with that medical treat-
ment where its use will prove most effective. It has
leaves like those of the anemone, divided like those
of celery, a head like that of the wild poppy upon a
small stalk, the root alsoa being like that of this
poppy, and saffron—coloured juice that is pungent and
sharp. It grows in cultivated fields. We Romans
distinguish three kinds of it, and the one esteemed
is that the root of which smells like frankincense.
