PREFACE

Î™ wlsn to thank Professor A. C. Andrews of the
University of Miami for the great help he has been
in the preparation of this volume. I sometimes refer
to him as A.C.A. Expert botanical knowledge is
essentia] for the solution of many problems that have
arisen, especially in the compilation of the Index qf
Plants. My rough draft of this he revised, making
many additions: these amount to several pages.
For the errors that inevitably remain in my work I
alone am responsible.

My thanks are also due to the staff of the Cam-
bridge School of Botany and to Professor C. O. Brink

of the same University.
