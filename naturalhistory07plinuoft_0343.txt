XLIX. For diseases ofthe bladder and for the cure Bladder

of stone, which causes as we have saida the most d

severe torture, help is obtained from polemonia taken
in wine, from agario, from leaves or root of plantain
taken in raisin wine, from betony as we prescribed it
for the liver 17; this last, 'taken in drink and used as
liniment, is good for hernia and wonderfully effective
for strangury. Some recommend betony, vei-vain
and millefolium, in equal parts and taken in water,
as a sovereign remedy for stone. It is certain that
strangury is cured by dittany also, and by cinquefoil
boiled down ‘co one third in wine. The latter pre-
paration is very useful to be taken, and to be used
loeally as a liniment, by sufferers from intestinal
hernia. The upper part of the root of xiphium also
is diure’ci03 it is given in water and applied locally
as linimen'c for intestinal hernia in infants. For
bladder troubles the juice of peucedanum is applied
locally‚ and psyllion is so applied for hernia and
umbilical rupture in infants. The two kinds of
anagallis are diuretic, as is a decoetion of root of
acoron, or ’che root by itself pounded and taken in
drink; these are good for all troubles of the
bladder,⁶ for stone both cotyledon and its root, and
also, for all inflammations of the genitals, equal parts
by weight of the stem, of the seed, and of myri-h.
Ebulum ground with its 'render leaves and taken in
wine expels stone, and applied locally cures com-
plaints of ’che testioles. Erigeron too with powdered
frankincense and sweet wine cures inflammation of
the testicles. Root of symphytum used as linimen'c
reduces intestinal hernia, and white hypocisthis is

depellit from the de ofr a, for depellit does not suit, the latter
noun. Brakman's demit is attractiva.
