INTRODUCTION

times only a consensus of several MSS. of the more
reliable kind. Vulg. = the textus receptus of the early
editions. Of FT x Mayhoff says: “ lectiones ita tantum
adnotatae sunt, ut e silentio nihil concludendum sit.'‘

The edition of Dalecamp (1587) has in the margin:
(l) readings of a lost MS.; (2) readings of a lost
edition or conjectures of an unknown scholar.

In the critical notes (1) is called “ cod. Dal.” and
(2) “ vet. Da1.”

As to the value of these MSS, Ι have generally
followed Mayhoff. The method adopted in fixing
the text has been to accept as correct the parts where
Detlefsen and Max hoff ‘10⁸1 ee except in a few places
where intel-nal evidence or the text of Dioscorides
pointed to anothei reading. Where these two
editors differ Ι have tried to choose the likelier of
the two readings. If Ι felt that neither alternative
could be accepted, I have sometimes ventured on
an emendation suggested by a friend or thought out
by myseff, but never, I hope, where a reasonable
reading is found in at least one MS. of fair authority.
Such a method as this would be unsafe were it not
for the fact thati May hoff 's apparatus criticus is both
full and trustw οι thy.

Although one who has not collated, or at least
personally examined, the MSS. in Mayhoff’ s apparatus,
cannot claim to appreciate fully their relative im-
portance, yet he must acquire, as he studies their
various readings, some conception of the weight to be
attached to them. Such a critic, however, should
exercise even greater caution than the critic fully
equipped for his task. For his judgment‚ however
great his knowledge is of Plinian usage, of the
parallel passages in Theophrastus and Dioscorides,
