BOOK XXV. xvm. 40—41

recognises its virtues after this fashion.‘¹ He
used them as pessaries for uterine troubles, adding
thereto honey, or oil of roses or osiris or of 111165,
3150 35 311 emmenagogue and to bring away the
after-birth. The same effects, he said, resulted from
taking them in drink and from using 1116111 for fomen-
tations. He dropped the juice into foul-smelling ears,
and with the juice and old wine made an embrocation
for 1116 abdomen. The leaves he applied to fluxes
from the eyes. A decoction of it with myrrh and
frankincense he prescribed for strangury and bladder
troubles. For loosening the bowels, however, or for
sever, a handful of the plant should be boiled down to
0116 half in two sextarii of water. This is drunk with
the addition of salt and honey, and if the decoction
has been made with a pig's foot or a chieken added,
the draught is all the more beneficial. Some have
thought that as a purge both kinds should be
administered, 6111161· by themselves or with mallows
added to the decoction.b They purge the abdomen ⁶
and bring away bile, but they are injurious to the
stomach. Their other uses we shall give in the
appropriate places.d

¹³ With Mayhoff⁷s conjecture in cibo: “ both kinds should
be given in food‚ boiled down with mallows”

⁶ This seems to be the meaning here of thorax, as it is of
θώραξ very often in Greek. Cf. Festugiere on [Hippocrates]
Ancient Medicina XXII, who quotes many passages proving
that θώραξ meant the entire cavity of the torso.

ά Throughout this chapter the translator misses the four
good MSS. VRdT. In many places the reading is uncertain,
and Ι have by emendations and changes of punctuation tried
to produce a better text than either Detlefsen or Mayhoff, with
an uneasy feeling that I have made no improvement, or
perhaps even made bad worse.
