harsh, the stem longer than that of the other kind
but very slender. It is used for the same purposes
as the iris.

CII. Of the aizoum there are two kinds, the Aizoffms«
larger of which is planted in earthen pots, and is ‘'²‘' eyes·
sometimes called buphthalmos,a zoophthalmos‚b
stergethron ⁶ (because it is useful for love-philtres)‚
hypogesond (for it generally grows under eaves),
although some prefer to call it ambrosia e or amerim-
non f; Italians call it great sedum, or eye, or little
finger. The other kind is rather small, and is called
erithalesfl trithales ἢ (because it flowers three times),
erysithales} isoetes,ff sedum by Italians, and both are
called aizoum, because they are always green, or sem-
pervivumst The greater aizoum grows to even more
than a cubit in height and is thieker than a thumb. At
the point the leaves are like a tongue, fleshy, rich with
copious juice, as broad as a thumb, some bent to the
ground and others upright, so that the circle of them
is like an eye in shape. The smaller aizoum grows
on walls, ruins, and roos-tiles3 it is bushy from the
root and leafy to the top, with narmw, pointed and
juicy leaves, and a stem a span high. The root is
not used.

CIII. Resembling this is a plant that the Greeks Andrachh
call wild andrachle, the Italians inlecebra. It has {egam ‘²¹‘
very small leaves, but broader than those of ⁶
aizoum, and the head is shorter It grows in roeky
districts and is gathered for food. All these have
the same properties; they are cooling and astrin-

u Luxuriant blossom. '¹ Thrice-blossoming.
