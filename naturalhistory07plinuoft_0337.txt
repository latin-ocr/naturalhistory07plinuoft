BOOK XXVI. va. 71—XLv1. 73

XLV. The seventh kind is surnamed dendroides,
and is called by some cobios, and by others lepto-
phyllos. It grows among rocks, and is the most
thickly headed of all the kinds. It has very largest
reddish stems, and an abundance of seed. The
properties are the same as those of characias.

XLVI. Apios ischas or raphanos agria spreads out
on the ground two or three rush-like stalks of a
reddish colour with leaves like those of rue. The
root is like that of an onion, but bigger‚ and this is the
reason why some call it the wild radish. Inside it
has a white pap, outside, dark skins. It grows in
rough‚ hilly spots, sometimes also in grass land.
Dug up in spring, it is pounded and immersed in an
earthen vessel.²³ After throwing away what floats
on the surface they use the juice that remains as a
purge and emetic, the dose being an obolus and a
half in hydromel. Prepared after this fashion a dose
of an acetabulum is also given for dropsy. The dried
root powdered is also sprinkled in a draught. They

going with cauliculis except the participle rubentibus.
Dioscorides is not of much help he says (IV, 164, 9). ο ’δὲ’ εν
ταῖς πέτραις φυόμενος, δενδροεΡιδὴς δε καλούμεν νο,ς ἀμφιλαφὴς
ἄνωθεν και πολύκομος, ὀποῦ μεστός, ὑπέρυθρος τοὺς κλάδους.

¹³ Theophrastus does not help us in deciding the meaning
of merqitur and supernatat, but Dioscorides 1s suggestive. His
words are (IV, 175). ὀπίσαι δὲ βουληθεί ις κόπτε τὰς ῥίζας καὶ
βαλὼν εἷς κρατηρίαν ὕδατος συνταραττε, καὶ τὸν ἐφιστάμενον
ὀπὸν πτερῷ ἄν ναλέγων ξήραιν νε· τούτου τρία ἡμιωβόλια ποθέντα
ἅνω και κάτω καθαίρει. In Pliny we have‘ immersed in an
earthen vessel,’' in Dioscorides‘ ‘ythrow into a bowl of water
and stir. ” 111 Pliny again the floating part is thrown away
and the remainder used; in Dioscorides (unless, unnaturally,
ξήραινε governs ῥίζας) it is collected, dried and used. Did
Pliny follow a different account 01· did he read ἀποβαλὼν where
now is read ἀναλέγων Y
