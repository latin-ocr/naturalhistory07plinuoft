BOOK XXV. xcv. 154-XCIX. 156

What is certain is that an application of hemlock to
the breasts of women in childbed dries up their milk,
and to rub it on the testacles at the time of puberty
acts as an antaphrodisiac. I should not like to give
directions about remedies in which hemlock is
recommended to be taken by the mouth. The
most powerful hemlock grows at Susa in Parthia3
the next in Laconia, Crete and Asia3 in Greece
however the strongest is found around Megara, after
which comes that of Attica.

XCVI. An application of wild cremnos to the omer reme-
eyes removes rheum, and with the addition of pearl glssfjffflme
barley reduces swellings.

XCVII. Molybdaena‚ that is plumbago, grows
everywhere, even on cultivated land3 it has a
leaf like that of lapathum and is thick α and hairy.
If the eye is licked b occasionally with this plant
when chewed, there is removed the species of eye
trouble called lead.

XCVIII. Capnos trunca,c the popular name of
which is chicken’s feet, growing among ruins and on
wall-banks, has very slender branches which are far
apart, a purple flower and green leaves3 its juice
disperses films, and so it is an ingredient of eye
salves.

XCIX. Similar both in name and in its properties,
though a different plant, is the bushy capnos,
which is very delicate, and has the leaves of coriander,
the colour of ashes, and a purple blossom. It grows in

medical term as this would be changed to anything so strange as
linqatm. The MSS. read either this or elinqaffizr, the 6- coming
from the final -e of subinde. For plumbum see list of diseases.

⁶ ‘⁴ Lopped '⁷ 01· ‘⁴ maimed fumitory,'' in contrast with the
capnos fruticosa of ξ 156.
