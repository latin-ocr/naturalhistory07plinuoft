scars smoothed out; also that albugo even of
draught animals is made better by sideritis. But α
chelidonia is a wonderful cure for all the above-

pearl barley is applied to the eyes for fluxes. For
checking such fluxes the seed of henbane is taken in
wine in doses of an obolus with the same amount of
poppy juice. Juice of gentian too is used as oint-

ingr-edient of the more pungent eye salves. Euphor-
beum too improves the vision of those whose eyes are
anointed with it. The juice of the plantain is
dropped into the eyes sor ophthalmia. Films are dis-

generally are made better by verbascum. To fluxes
is applied peristereos in rose oil or vinegar. For cata—

rubbed on the forehead arrests fluxes.

the female with a blue one3 neither is more than a
span in height, the stem being tender, and the leaves
tiny, round and lying on the ground. They grow in
gardens and on moist ground. The blue-flowered
kind blossoms first. The juice of either kind, applied
with honey, disperses film on the eyes, suffusions of
blood from a blow, and reddish argema ε’; the results
