CXVII. There is also tragopogon, called by some Traqopoqon.
come, with a small stem, leaves like those of saffron, a
long, sweet root, and at the top of the stem a broad,
dark calyx It grows on rugged soils, and is eaten

but never used 1n medicine

CXVIII. Such is all that I have been told or dis· Δσεα nd
covered worth recording about plants. At the close, [ἐ 1⁶] ⁰s
I think it not out of place to add a warning that their
properties vary with their age. As I have said,“
elaterium lasts longest, dalk chamaeleon forty years,
centaury not more than twelve, peucedanum and
aristolochia up to six, and the wild vine one year—-
that is, if they are kept in the shade. And of ex-
ternal animals indeed none attack the roots that I
have mentioned except the sphondyle a kind of
creeping thing, b which infests them all.

CXIX. There is no doubt either that the potency Dr 1er an nd
and efficacy of all roots are lessened if the fruit⁰ '¹⁰ 'W'
ripens before they are dug, and it is the same with
seeds if the root has been cut previously for the sake
of the juice. The properties moreover of all plants
are weakened by habit, and they cease to be bene-
ficial when needed if they have been in daily use;
similarly with harmful plants. All plants however
have greater efficacy and potency when they grow in
cold regions subject to north-east winds, and likewise
those that grow in dry.

CXX. There are also considerable differences
between races. I have heard for instance about
tapeworms and maw-worms‚ that they infest the
peoples of Egypt, Arabia, Syria and Cilicia, while on
the contrary they are never found at all among those
of Thrace and Phrygia. This is less remarkable than
their being found among the Thebans, but not among
