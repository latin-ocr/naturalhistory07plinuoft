INDEX OF PLANTS

Problems incidental to the identification of plants mentioned
by Pliny have already been discussed (Vol. VI, Introd„ pp.
xvi-xviii).

The identifications of such early editors of the waima(
History as Hardouin (1713), Fee (1826), Bostock and Riley
(1855), and Littre (1855) are unreliable, since data on the
actual flora of Italy and Greece were then inexact; and there
has been no systematic, comprehensive approach to the
problem in the succeedjng century. Many of the plants
mentioned by Pliny are discusses] also by Dioscorides; but
the more recent editions of Dioscorides, such as those of
Berendes (1902) and Gunther (1934), mostly list the identifi-
cations of such early scholars as Sprengel, Fraas, and Daubeny.
As for Theophrastus, only in the case of Sir William Thiselton-
Dyer’s index of plants in the LCL edition of his Enquiry insto
Plants by Sir Arthur Hort is consideration given to the
scientific enumeration of the native plants of Greece by E. de
Halacsy 111 his Conspectus florae Graecae (1901-1904, supple-
ments 1908 and 1912) and special research prosecuted by De
Candolle, Hanbury, Yule, Sfflweinfurth, Bretzl, and others.
Halacsy' s work lias been refined by M. R’ikli and E. Riibel 111
their article, “Uber Flora und Vegetation von Kreta und
Griechenland” ( Vveoteljahrsschrzst der natursorschevden (1688ῖῖ-
schaft in Zurzch, 68 [1923], pp. 103- 227), and there 15 also
available Rikli's general survey of the Mediterranean flora,
Das Pflanzenkleid der M ittelmeerlcinder (1943 and 1946). As
for Italy, we now have Adriano Fiori’s comprehensive
survey, Nuovaflora a'nczlitica d'Italz'a (1923-1929), and Eugenio
Baroni's briefer compendium, (J'fmssda botanica d'ltalia (1932).
Problems relative to cultivated plants have been considerably
clarified by the work of Elisabeth Schiemann (Die Entstehuml
