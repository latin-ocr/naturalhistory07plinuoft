good for any kind of sore, and root of astragalus,
beaten to powder, for ulcers that are running, and so
is callithrix boiled down in water3 specific however
for sores caused by footwear is vei-vain, crushed
lysimachia also, and dried nymphaea reduced to
powder. But when these last have become chronic
polythrix proves more useful.

LXXXVIII. Polycnemon is like ox cunila, and its
seed resembles that of pennyroyal3 it has a wood-
like stem with many joints, and its clusters are scented,
with a pungent but sweet smell. When chewed it is
applied to cuts made by iron, but is taken off on the
fifth day. Symphyton very quickly causes a sear to
form, as also does sideritis, which is applied with
honey. The seed and leaves of verbascum, boiled
down in wine and beaten up, bring away everything
embedded in the flesh, as do mandrake leaves with
pearl barley, or cyclamen roots with honey. Trixago
leaves crushed in oi] are applied especially to spread-
ing ulcers, as is also sea-weed beaten up in honey3
betony, with the addition of salt, is used for carci-
noma and chronic pustules ‘1 on the neck.

LXXXIX. WVarts are removed by argemonia in
vinegar, by root of batrachium, which also brings
away scabrous nails, and by an application of the
leaves or juice of either kind of linozostis. All kinds
of tithymallus remove all kinds of wart-s, hangnails‚
and pimples b on the face. Ladanum smooths away
scars and restores the colour. A traveller who has
artemisia andC elelisphacus tied on him does not,
they say, feel any fatigue.

⁶ Or, “eruptions.'’
⁰ Is et here equivalent to “ or ”2 The plural (alliyalas)
seems against this.
