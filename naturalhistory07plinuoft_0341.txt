BOOK XXVI. vam. 75—77

XLVIII. Agaric taken in drink, the dose being
three oboli in one cyathus of old 111116, 15 good for
disorders of the spleen‚ as is the root in honey wine
of all kinds of panaces, but best of all is teucria, dried
and taken in drink by boiling down to one hemina ‘²
a handful of it with three heminae of vinegar. In
vinegar it is also used as a liniment, or, if that cannot
be borne, in figs or water. Polemonia is taken in
wine, 01· a drachma of betony in three cyathi of
oxymel, or aristolochia as used for snake bite.
Argemonia, taken in food on seven consecutive days,
is said to reduce the spleen, and so are two oboli of
agaric in oxymel. It is reduced also by the root of
nymphaea heraclia taken in wine or by itself. Ciss-
anthemus, if a drachma is taken twice daily in two
cyathi of white wine for forty days, is said to carry off
the spleen gradually in the urine. Useful too is a
decoction of hyssop with fig, or of the root of lonchitis
before it sheds its seed, while a decoction of root of
peucedanum is good for both spleen and kidneys.
The spleen is reduced by the juice of acoron taken
by the mouth—the roots are very useful for trouble
of the hypochondria and groin b—by the seed of
clymenus taken in drink for thirty days, the dose
being a denarius by weight in white wine, by
powdered betony taken in honey and squill vinegar,
and by root of lonchitis in water. Teucrium ⁶ is used
as liniment‚ likewise scordium vss‘th wax, or agaric
with powdered fenugreek.

'² It seems most natural to mend the grammar of this
passage by making praecordiis . . . radices a parenthesis, a
favourite trick of Pliny, and understanding consumit or utile
before clymeni.

⁰ Notice both forms, teucria and teucrium, in the same
chapter.
