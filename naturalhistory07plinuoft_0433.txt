therefore some have called the plant and1·osaem0n.⁰
Two-drachmae doses of the seed, taken in a sex-
tarius of hydromeL are used for sciatica. It loosens
the bowels, brings away bile, and is applied to burns.

XXI. Aphaca has very slender and tiny ⁰ leaves.
Taller than the lentil it also bears lai-ger pods, in
which are three or four seeds, darker and smaller
than those of the lentil. It grows in cultivated fields‚
and has bracingc qualities more powerful than those
of the lentil, its other uses being the same. A de-
coction of the seed checks fluxes of the stomach and
bowels.

XXII. In my authorities I have found no descrip-
tion of alcibium, but only that its pounded root and
leaves are applied locally, and taken in drink, for
snake bite3 a handful of the pounded leaves with
three cyathi of neat wine, or three drachmae by
weight of the root with the same measure of wine.

XXIII. Alectoros lophos, which we Romans call
“ comb ’⁷ (crista), has several leaves like a cock's comb,
a slender stem, and black seed in pods. Boiled with
ground beans it is useful for cough, and with the
addition of honey for film on the eyes. The seed is
cast whole into the eye3 it does no harm but
attracts the film to itself. Changing colour it begins
to turn from black to white, swells‚ and works out by
itself.

XXIV. We Romans call alum what the Greeks call
symphyton petraeum. It is like ox cunila, with
small leaves and three or four branches growing from
φακοῦ ὑψηλότερος, λεπτόφυλλος. The Greek suggests that
pusilla may be an addition (either by Pliny himself or by a
scribe) to explain tenuia, but Pliny may have had before him

a different Greek text.
