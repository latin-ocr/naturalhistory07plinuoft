BOOK XXIV. xxxv. 51—53

XXXV. The elder has a second, a much smaller The elder-
species, growing wilder and called by the Greeks
chamaeacte, by others helion. A decoction in old
wine of the leaves, seed, 01· root, of either species,
taken as drink up to two cyathi for a dose, is bad for
the stomach, though carrying off watery humours
from the bowels. It also reduces inflammation,
especially that of a recent burn, and a dog-bite is
relieved by a poultice of its most tender leaves with
pearl barley. An applicationa of the juice sostens
gatherings on the brain, being specific when these are
on the membrane that surrounds it. Its berries have
weaker properties than the other parts. They dye
the hair. A (lose of one acetabulum taken in drink is
diuretic. The softest of the leaves are eaten with oil
and salt to bring away phlegm and bile. For all
purposes the smaller kind is the more efficacious. A
decoction of the root in wine, taken in doses of two
cyathi, draws off the water of dropsy3 it also softens
the uterus, as does also sitting in baths of a decoction
of the leaves. The tender stalks of the cultivated
elder boiled in a saucepan relax the bowels 3 the leaves
taken in wine also counteract the bites of snakes.
An application of young shoots with goat-suet is very
good for gout3 these are also stceped in water to kill
fleas by sprinkling. If a place is sprinkled with a
decoction of the leaves flies are killed. Boa ὸ 15 the
name given to a disease when the body is red with
pimples; beating with a branch of elder is admin-
istered as a remedy. The inner bark pounded and
taken in white wine relaxes the bowels.

that (1156356 was probably not known until the time of Rhazes.
