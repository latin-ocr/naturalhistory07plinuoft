LVII. An agaric grows as a white fungus on trees Aqarric.
around the Bosporus. A dose is four oboli crushed
and two cyathi of oxymel. The kind that grows in
Gaul a is considered of inferior strength3 further‚⁰
the male is firmer and more bitter——this kind
causes headaches—but the female is softer, and at
first its taste is sweet, but afterwards turns bitter.c

LVIII. Echios of either kind is like pennyroyald ; Echios.
its foliage is used for chaplets. The dose is two
drachmae in four cyathi of wine3 likewise e with the
second kind, which is marked by a prickly down, and
also has little heads like a viper’s3 this is taken in
wine and vinegar. Some give the name echios to
personata (⁴⁴ masked plant '’) whose leaf is broader
than that of any kind,s and which bears large burs.
A decoction of the root of this is given with vinegar as a

ά The MSS. give no variant, and only Jan among the
editors thinks that something is wrong, or missing, here.
So I have done my best to make sense of Mayhoff's text, but
I suspect, with Jan, that there is a lacuna after yeneris. The
missing words would be something giving the sense of :
contra serpentes (aspiciam) utilis. altera, ‘⁴ is good for the
poison of snakes (asps 5²). The first kind is like etc.'‘ Perhaps
a sleepy scribe was led astray by the like endings of utilis
and similis. An altera to correspond to the item altera of the
next sentence is required, and some versions, including
Littre‘s, assume its presence.

ε The translators, so far as Ι have seen, omit item. I
think that it refers to the dosage, and means that the dose
of the second kind is two drachmae of the herb to four cyathi
of liquid; only the latter, as we see from the end of the sentence,
is winc and vinegar. not wine only.

J Apparently ‘⁶ of any other kind of echios”. The Latin,
however, 1n any other context, would surely mean, “ than any
other leaf (of any plant),’‘ which is absurd. Perhaps there is
another lacuna here. The text of this whole chapter is odd,
and the last sentence, about henbane, seems out of place.
