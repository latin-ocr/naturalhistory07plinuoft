BOOK XXVII. 11. 5-9

Although by themselves both are deadly‚ yet the two
poisons in a human being perish together so that the
human survives. Moreover even remedies used by wild
beasts have been handed down by the ancients‚ who
have shown how venomous α creatures also by them-
selves obtain healing. Scorpions, touched by aconite‚
become numbed‚ and are pale and stupefied, acknow-
ledging their defeat. They find a help in white
hellebore, its touch dispelling the torpor; the aconite
yields to two evil foes, one peculiar to itself and one
common to all creatur-es. If anyone believes that
these discoveries could, by any chance, have been
made by a man, he shows himself ungrateful
for the gods’ gifts. They touch ὓ flesh with aconite,
and kill panthers by a mere taste of it, otherwise
panthers would overrun the regions where they are
found. For this reason some have called aconite
pardalianches, that is panther-strangler. But it has
been proved that panthers are at once saved from
this death by tasting human excrement3 surely
nobody doubts that this remedy has been found by
Chance‚ and that on every occasion it is even today a
new find, since wild animals have neither reason nor
experience for results to be passed from one to
another. This Chance therefore, this is that great
deity who has made most of the discoveries that
enrich our life, this is the name of him by whom is
meant she who is at once the Mother and the
Mistress of all creation. Either guess is equally
likely, whether we judge that wild animals make
these discoveries every day or that they possess a
never-failing instinct. Again it is shameful that all
animals except man know what is health—giving for
themselves. Our ancestors however advertised the
