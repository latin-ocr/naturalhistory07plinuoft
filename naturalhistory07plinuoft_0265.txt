BOOK XXV. xcv. 151—154

XCV. Hemlock too is poisonous, a plant with a
bad name because the Athenians made it their
instrument of capital punishment, but its uses for
many purposes must not be passed by. It has a.
poisonous seed, but the stem is eaten by many
both as a salad and when cooked in a saucepan.
This stem is smooth, and jointed like a reed, of a dark
colour, often more than two cubit-s high, and branchy
at the top3 the leaves resemble those of coriander,
but are more tender, and ofa strong smell ; the seed is
coarser than that of anise, the root hollow and of no
use. The seed and leaves have a chilling quality, and
it is this that causes death; the body begins to grow
cold at the extremities. The remedy lies in using the
wax-ming nature of wine before the vital parts are
reached3 but taken in wine hemlock is invariably
fatal. A juice is e-xtracted from the leaves and
blossom‚ for the best time to do so is when the
hemlock is in flower. A better juiee is extracted
from the crushed seed and thickened in the sun for
making into lozenges. It causes death by thieken-
ing the blood—this is its other outstanding property
—and for this reason spots are to be seen on the
bodies of those who have been killed in this way.
This juice is used instead of water as a solvent
for drugs. There is also made from it 3 poultice to
cool the stomach. Its chief use however is as a local
application round the eyes to check summer fluxes
and to allay pains in them. It forms an ingredient
of eye salves, and it checks all catarrhs generally.
The leaves also relieve every kind of swelling, pain or
flux. Anaxilaus is responsible for the statement that
if the breasts are rubbed with hemloek from adult
maidenhood onwards they will always remain firm.
