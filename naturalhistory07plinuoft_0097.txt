LXIV. I have mentioneda the different* kinds of Gunu-
gums. The better the sort of each kind the more
potent its effect. Gums are injurious to the teeth‚
coagulate blood and therefore benefit those who spit
blood; they are also good for burns though bad for
affections of the trachea3 they promote urine and
lessen the bitter taste in things. Gums generally are
acrid‚⁶ but the gum that comes from bitter almonds,
and is more efficacious for giving astringency to
the internal organs, possesses heating propertieS.
The gums from plums‚ cheri-ies and vines are less
esteemed. An application of gum has drying and
astringent properties‚ in vinegar moreover it cures
lichens on babies, and four oboli taken in must ⁶ are
good for a chronic cough. Gums are believed to
improve the complexion and also the appetite3 they

θερμαίνει, shows that the bitter almond is referred to, but
the run of the sentence makes us expect a nominative adjective
to be joined to efficacior. Perhaps—it is only a guess—the
sentence should run τ adstrictis celeris, qvae em amyqslala amara
<excipitur amara> est spissandi-sque visceribus efficacior,- habet
excalfactorias vires. The logio of the passage would be that
other gums lessen bitter tastes, but gum from bitter almonds
is itself bitter.

ture.'' Moreover, in is not the usual preposition in such
phrases, but ex or cum. This objection, of course, applies to
musto as much as to mixto. M usto, however, is probably right,
although immixtarum, “ four oboli of mixed gums ’' would suit
the sense of the passage and avoid the difficulty ofin. But
were immistam the original reading, it is hard to understand
why it was altered to in mixto.
