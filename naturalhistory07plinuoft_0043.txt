authorities that a moderate dose dispels melancholy‚
but that a larger one causesa it3 that an injec-

XVI. Spomlylium, which I described at the sanie
time‚⁶ is with old 011 poured 011 1110 heads of sufferers
from phrenitis, lethargus and headache of long
standing. It is also taken in drink foi· affections
of 1110 liver, for jaundice, epilepsy, asthma, and
0110111113ἱ of 1110 11101115; for ’these d fumigation is
also beneficial. It 10050115 1110 bowels. With rue it
15 used as a 111111110111 for spreading sores. The
blossom ⁶ 15 injected with good results 11110 purulent
ears, but the juice, when 11 iss being exhi-acted, must
be covered over, since 11 has a wonderful attraction for
flies and such-like 11150015. The shavings of the 1001
inserted 11110 fistulas eat away 111011· 00110511105. They

affections of 1110 liver and of the uterus. If
the head is rubbed with itfl 1110 hair becomes

‘ By ‘⁶ blossom ” Pliny means 1110 juioe of 1110 flowers, as we
see from Dioscorides III. 76 (Wellmann) : τοῦ δὲ ἄνθους χλώρου
ὁ χυλὸς πρὸς ἡλκωμένα ὦτα καὶ πυορροῦντα ἁρμόζει. Here once
more Pliny and Dioscorides are very alike for a whole chapter,
and 1110 0110 ean be safely checked by the other.

s By using 1110 present (exprimitur) Pliny implies that 1110

juice must be at once covered up.
θ Again juiee 15 meant, as is shown by peruncto.
