slender,a about three spans high, with a root 0116 span
less, and with leaves around the bottom of the stem
resembling those of rue. The seed is on the twigs,

hanging down in cluster,s and has a vinous smell;

and so the plant is called botrys θ by some, although
others call it artemisia. The C·1ppadocians use it for
chaplets. In medicine it is used as a discutient.

XII. Anonis, which some prefer to call ononis,
is branchy‚ and like fenugreek, except that it is
more bushy and more hairy. It has an agreeable
smell‚ and becomes prickly after spring. Preserved
in brine it is also used as food, while the fresh plant
cauterizes the edges of ulcers. The root is boiled
down in vinegar and water for tooth-ache‚ and taken
in drink with honey it also expels stone from the
bladder. For epilepsy it is given in oxymel boiled
down to one half.

ΧΙΙΙ. Anao gyros, which some call acopon, is bushy,
with a strong osmell and a flower like that of cabbage.
The seed grows in little horn-like pods of some
length3 it is kidney-shaped and becomes hard
during the harvests. The leaves are placed on
gatherings‚ and tied as an amulet on women in
difficult labour, care being taken to remove them
immediately after delivery. But if a dead foetus
does not come away, or if the after-birth or men-
struation is retarded, the leaves are taken in raisin-
wine, a dose being a drachma. Similar doses are
given for asthma, and in old wine the leaves are given
for the bites of poisonous spiders. The root is em-
ployed to disperse or mature boils; the seed chewed
acts as an emetic.
