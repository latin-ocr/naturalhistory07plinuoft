BOOK XXVI. 111. 3—4

forefathers. It first made its way into Italy in the
middle of the principate of Tiberius Claudius Caesar,
when a Roman knight of Perusia, a quaestor's

and middle classes, but the nobles were very much

first introduction usually attack whole masses indiscriminately.
How strange it is for a disease sometimes to piek as it were its
victims ! '¹ It is hard for me to believe that contra 15 an
