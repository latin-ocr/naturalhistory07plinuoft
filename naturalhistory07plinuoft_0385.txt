epistaxis, by aizoum and by root of astragalus.
Ischaemon too and achillia check bleeding.
LXXXIII. Equisaetum, called hippuris by the Equisaetnm

Greeks, and found fault with by me when I discussed
meadow land ‘²——it is in fact “ hair of the earth ”
resembling horse hair—reduces the spleen of runners
if as much as the pot will hold is boiled down to one
third in new earth enware, and taken in drink for three
days in doses of one hemina. There must be ab·
stinence from fatty foods for at least one day
previously. The Greeks hold various views about
this plant; some under the same name speak of
a dark plant xw'th leaves like those of the pine,
assuring us that, so wonderful is its nature, its mere
touch stanches a patient’s bleedingg some call it
hippuris, others ephedron, others anabasis. Their
account is that it grows near trees, which it climbs,
and hangs down in many dark, rusb-like hairs as
if from a horse's tail; that its little branches
are jointed, and its leaves few, slenderb and small3
that the seed is round, resembling that of coriander,
that its root is ligneous, and that it grows mostly
in plantations. Its property is to brace ⁶ the body.
Its juice, kept 111 the nostrils, checks haemorrhage
therefrom, and it also checks looseness of the
bowels. Taken in a sweet wine, in doses of three
cyathi, it is good for dysentery, promotes passing of
urine, and cures cough and orthopnoea, ruptures
also and spreading sores. The leaves are taken in
drink for complaints of the bowels and bladder3
the plant itself reduces intestina] hernia. The
Greeks recognise yet another hippuris, which has
shorter, softer and paler hairs, making a very useful
application in vinegar d for sciatica, and also for cuts,e
