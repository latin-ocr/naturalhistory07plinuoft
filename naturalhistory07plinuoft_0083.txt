XLIX The plant called cissos erythranos by the Plan nst [ik-e
Greeks is like ivy. Taken in wine it is oood forn y·
sciatica and lumbago; so strong is the property
of the berry that it &brings away blood in the urine.
Chamaecissos again is the name theye aive to an ivy
that never rises t:from the ground. This too crushed
in wine and taken in doses of an acetabulum cures
splenic trouble3 the leaves with axle-grease are
applied to burns. The milax also, which has the
further name of anthophoros (flower-bearer)‚ has a
likeness to the ivy, though the leaves are more slender.
A chaplet of it made with an odd number of leaves is
said to be a cure for headache. Some authorities have
declared that there are two kinds of milax. One is
very nearly everlasting, grows in shaded valleys, is a
climber of trees, bears berries in luxuriant clusters, and
is most efficacious against all poisonous things to such
a degree that, if the juice of the beri-ies is repeatedly
administered α in drops to babies, no poison will here-
after do them any harm. The other kind is said to be
fond of cultivated ground and to grow there, having
no medicinal value. The former milax they state to
be the 0116 the wood of which, we saidss' gives out a
sound when placed close to the ear. Like it is the
plant that some have called clematis,c which climbs
along trees and is itself jointed. Its leaves cleanse
leprous sores; its seed loosens the bowels if an
acetabulum of it is taken in a hemina of water or in
hydromel. A decoction of it is administered for the
same purpose.

‘¹ Instillato is difficult. The verb is often used of dropping
into the ears, and that may be the meaning here, but auribus

would be expected. Perhaps Pliny wrote infantium auribus,

which might easily be ‘⁴ teleseoped ‘' into infantibus.
