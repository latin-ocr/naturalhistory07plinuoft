BOOK XXV. xxxvm. 77—79

XXXVIII. In the age too of our fathers King Euphorbea.
Jubaa discoveredb a plant to which he gave the
name euphorbea‚ calling it after his own physician
Euphorbus. This man was the brother of the Musa
we have mentioned⁶ as the saviour of the life of the
late Emperor Augustus. It was these brothers who
first adopted the plan of bracing the body by copious
douches of cold water after the bath. Before this
the custom was to bathe in hot water only, as we
find that it is also in Homer. But the treatise also of
,Iuba on this plant is still extant, and it makes a
splendid testimonial. He discovered it on Mount
Atlas: it has the appearance of a thyrsus and the
leaves of the acanthus. Its potency is so great that
the juice, obtained by incision with a pole, is gathered
from a distance3 it is caught in receivers made of
kids’ stomachs placed underneath. Fluid and like
milk as it drops down, when it has dried and con-
gealed it has all the features of frankincense. The
collectors find their vision improved. It is em-
ployed as treatment for snake-bite. In whatever
part of the body the bite may be, an incision is made
in the top of the skull and the medicament in-
serted there. The Gaetulians who gather the juice
adulterate it out of weary disgust by adding milk,
but fire is a test of genuineness, for that which is
adulterated emits a nauseating smell. Far inferior
to the Atlas juice is that which in Gaul comes from
the ground-olive, which bears a red berry like kermes.
Broken it resembles hammoniacum, and even a
slight taste leaves for a long time a burning sensation
in the mouth; after a while this increases until it
dries up even the throat.
