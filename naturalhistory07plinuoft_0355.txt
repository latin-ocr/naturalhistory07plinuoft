BOOK XXVI. Lx. 92-LXI. 94

LX. Superficial abscess is cured by panaces in Ouresfor

honey, plantain with salt, cinquefoil, root of persol— ξιᾊζῖζζξεῗξ
lata administered as for scrofula3 also by dama-
sonium and by verbascum, pounded with its root,
sprinkled with wine, wrapped round with its leaves,
and heated, thus prepared, on embers, so that it
may be applied hot. Those with experience have
assured us that it makes all the difference if, while
the patient is fasting, the poul’tice is laid upon him
by a maiden‚ herself fasting and naked, who must
touch him with the back of her hand and say:
“ Apollo tells us that a plague cannot grow more
fiery in a patient if a naked maiden queneh the
fire3 ” and with her hand so reversed she must
repeat the formula three times, and both must spit
on ’che ground three times. Other cures are man-
drake root in water, a decoction of scammony root
with honey, sideritis crushed with stale grease‚
marruvium with stale axle-grease, or chrysippios—-
another plant named after its discoverer—with
plump figs.

LXI. Nymphaea heraclia, as Ι have said‚‘² takes anr'bae'
away altogether sexual desire; a single draught of heraclm.
it does so for forty days3 sexual dreams too are
prevented if it is taken in drink on an empty
stomach andb eaten with food. Applied to the
genitals the root also checks not only desire but
also excessive accumulation of semen. For this
reason it is said to make flesh and to improve
the voice. Sexual desire is excited by the
upper part of xiphium root given in wine as
a draught3 also by the plant called cremnos
agrios and by ormenos agrios crushed with pearl

barley.
